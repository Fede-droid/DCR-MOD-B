Substances consumed for nutrition
This article is about food for all organisms. For food for humans, see
Human food
. For other uses, see
Food (disambiguation)

Display of various foods
Food
is any substance consumed by an
organism
for
nutritional
support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or
fungal
origin and contains essential nutrients such as
carbohydrates
,
fats
,
proteins
,
vitamins
, or
minerals
. The substance is
ingested
by an organism and assimilated by the organism's
cells
to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different
feeding behaviours
that satisfy the needs of their
metabolisms
and have evolved to fill a specific
ecological niche
within specific geographical contexts.
Omnivorous
humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Humans generally use
cooking
to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the
food energy
required is supplied by the industrial
food industry
, which produces food through
intensive agriculture
and distributes it through complex
food processing
and
food distribution
systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on
fossil fuels
, which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the
major contributors to climate change
, accounting for as much as 37% of total
greenhouse gas emissions
.
[1]
The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues, including
sustainability
,
biological diversity
,
economics
,
population growth
,
water supply
, and
food security
.
Food safety
and security are monitored by international agencies like the
International Association for Food Protection
, the
World Resources Institute
, the
World Food Programme
, the
Food and Agriculture Organization
, and the
International Food Information Council
.
Definition and classification
A typical aquatic food web
Food is any substance consumed to provide
nutritional
support and energy to an
organism
.
[2]
[3]
It can be raw, processed, or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health, or pleasure. Food is mainly composed of water,
lipids
,
proteins
, and
carbohydrates
. Minerals (e.g., salts) and organic substances (e.g.,
vitamins
) can also be found in food.
[4]
Plants,
algae
, and some microorganisms use
photosynthesis
to make some of their own nutrients.
[5]
Water is found in many foods and has been defined as a food by itself.
[6]
Water and
fiber
have low energy densities, or
calories
, while fat is the most energy-dense component.
[3]
Some inorganic (non-food) elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning.
[7]
Human food can be classified in various ways, either by related content or by how it is processed.
[8]
The number and composition of
food groups
can vary. Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin and relative nutritional function: Vegetables and Fruit, Cereals and Bread, Dairy, and Meat.
[9]
Studies that look into diet quality group food into whole grains/cereals, refined grains/cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, eggs, dairy products, fish, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages.
[10]
[11]
[12]
The
Food and Agriculture Organization
and
World Health Organization
use a system with nineteen food classifications: cereals, roots, pulses and nuts, milk, eggs, fish and shellfish, meat, insects, vegetables, fruits, fats and oils, sweets and sugars, spices and condiments, beverages, foods for nutritional uses, food additives, composite dishes and savoury snacks.
[13]

In a given ecosystem, food forms a
web
of interlocking
chains
with
primary producers
at the bottom and
apex predators
at the top.
[14]
Other aspects of the web include
detrovores
(that eat
detritis
) and
decomposers
(that break down dead organisms).
[14]
Primary producers include algae, plants, bacteria and protists that acquire their energy from sunlight.
[15]
Primary consumers are the
herbivores
that consume the plants, and secondary consumers are the
carnivores
that consume those herbivores. Some organisms, including most mammals and birds, diet consists of both animals and plants, and they are considered omnivores.
[16]
The chain ends with the apex predators, the animals that have no known predators in its ecosystem.
[17]
Humans are considered apex predators.
[18]
Humans are omnivores, finding sustenance in vegetables, fruits, cooked meat, milk, eggs, mushrooms and seaweed.
[16]
Cereal grain is a
staple food
that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.
[19]
Corn (maize)
, wheat, and rice account for 87% of all grain production worldwide.
[20]
[21]
[22]
Just over half of the world's crops are used to feed humans (55 percent), with 36 percent grown as animal feed and 9 percent for
biofuels
.
[23]
Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of
fermented
foods like
bread
,
wine
,
cheese
and
yogurt
.
[24]
Bacteria
Without bacteria, life would scarcely exist because bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into nutritious
ammonia
.  Ammonia is the precursor to proteins, nucleic acids, and most vitamins.  Since the advent of industrial process for nitrogen fixation, the
Haber-Bosch Process
, the majority of ammonia in the world is human-made.
[25]
Plants
Foods from plant sources
Photosynthesis
is the source of most energy and food for nearly all life on earth.
[26]
Photosynthesis is one main source of biomass, the food for plants, algae and certain bacteria and, indirectly, organisms higher in the food chain.
[27]
[28]
Energy from the sun is absorbed and used to transform water and carbon dioxide in the air or soil into oxygen and glucose. The oxygen is then released, and the glucose stored as an energy reserve.
[29]
Plants also absorb important nutrients
and minerals from the air, natural waters, and soil.
[30]
Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air or water and are the basic nutrients needed for plant survival.
[31]
The three main nutrients absorbed from the soil for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, with other important nutrients including calcium, sulfur, magnesium, iron boron, chlorine, manganese, zinc, copper molybdenum and nickel.
[31]
Plants as a food source
are divided into seeds, fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts.
[32]
Where plants fall within these categories can vary, with botanically described fruits such as the tomato, squash, pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables.
[33]
Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the
reproductive tissue
, so seeds, nuts and grains are technically fruit.
[34]
[35]
From a culinary perspective, fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains, nuts, seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed.
[36]
Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest, with cereal grains (oats, wheat, rice, corn, barley, rye, sorghum and millet) belonging to the
Poaceae
(grass) family
[37]
and pulses coming from the
Fabaceae
(legume) family.
[38]
Whole grains
are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed (bran, germ, and
endosperm
).
[39]
Nuts are dry fruits, distinguishable by their woody shell.
[36]
Fleshy fruits (distinguishable from dry fruits like grain, seeds and nuts) can be further classified as
stone fruits
(cherries and peaches),
pome fruits
(apples, pears),
berries
(blackberry, strawberry),
citrus
(oranges, lemon),
melons
(watermelon, cantaloupe), Mediterranean fruits (grapes, fig),
tropical fruits
(banana, pineapple).
[36]
Vegetables refer to any other part of the plant that can be eaten, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers, bark or the entire plant itself.
[40]
These include
root vegetables
(potatoes and carrots), bulbs (onion family), flowers (cauliflower and broccoli),
leaf vegetables
(
spinach
and lettuce) and
stem vegetables
(celery and
asparagus
).
[41]
[40]
The carbohydrate, protein and lipid content of plants is highly variable. Carbohydrates are mainly in the form of starch, fructose, glucose and other sugars.
[32]
Most vitamins are found from plant sources, with exceptions of
vitamin D
and
vitamin B
12
.
Minerals
can also be plentiful or not. Fruit can consist of up to 90% water, contain high levels of
simple sugars
that contribute to their sweet taste, and have a high
vitamin C
content.
[32]
[36]
Compared to fleshy fruit (excepting Bananas) vegetables are high in starch,
[42]
potassium
, dietary fiber,
folate
and vitamins and low in fat and calories.
[43]
Grains are more starch based
[32]
and nuts have a high protein, fibre, vitamin E and B content.
[36]
Seeds are a good source of food for animals because they are abundant and contain fibre and healthful fats, such as
omega-3 fats
.
[44]
[45]
Complicated chemical interactions can enhance or depress bioavailability of certain nutrients.
Phytates
can prevent the release of some sugars and vitamins.
[32]
Animals that only eat plants are called
herbivores
, with those that mostly just eat fruits known as
frugivores
,
[46]
leaves, while shoot eaters are
folivores
(pandas) and wood eaters termed
xylophages
(termites).
[47]
Frugivores
include a diverse range of species from annelids to elephants, chimpanzees and many birds.
[48]
[49]
[50]
About 182 fish consume seeds or fruit.
[51]
Animals (domesticated and wild) use as many types of grasses that have adapted to different locations as their main source of nutrients.
[52]
Humans eat thousands of plant species; there may be as many as 75,000 edible species of
angiosperms
, of which perhaps 7,000 are often eaten.
[53]
Plants can be processed into breads, pasta, cereals, juices and jams or raw ingredients such as sugar, herbs, spices and oils can be extracted.
[32]
Oilseeds
are pressed to produce rich oils – ⁣
sunflower
,
flaxseed
,
rapeseed
(including
canola oil
) and
sesame
.
[54]
Many plants and animals have
coevolved
in such a way that the fruit is a good source of nutrition to the animal who then excretes the seeds some distance away, allowing greater dispersal.
[55]
Even
seed predation
can be mutually beneficial, as some seeds can survive the digestion process.
[56]
[57]
Insects are major eaters of seeds,
[44]
with ants being the only real seed dispersers.
[58]
Birds, although being major dispersers,
[59]
only rarely eat seeds as a source of food and can be identified by their thick beak that is used to crack open the seed coat.
[60]
Mammals eat a more diverse range of seeds, as they are able to crush harder and larger seeds with their teeth.
[61]
Animals
Various raw meats
Animals are used as food
either directly or indirectly. This includes meat, eggs, shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese.
[62]
They are an important source of protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs.
[63]
One 4-ounce (110 g) steak, chicken breast or pork chop contains about 30 grams of protein. One large egg has 7 grams of protein. A 4-ounce (110 g) serving of cheese has about 15 grams of protein. And 1 cup of milk has about 8 grams of protein.
[63]
Other nutrients found in animal products include calories, fat, essential vitamins (including B12) and minerals (including zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium).
[63]
Food products produced by animals include milk produced by
mammary glands
, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into
dairy products
(cheese, butter, etc.).
Eggs
laid by birds and other animals are eaten and
bees
produce
honey
, a reduced
nectar
from flowers that is used as a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures
consume blood
, such as in
blood sausage
, as a thickener for sauces, or in a
cured
,
salted
form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as
jugged hare
.
[64]
Taste
Main article:
Taste
Animals, specifically humans, typically have five different types of tastes:
sweet
,
sour
,
salty
,
bitter
, and
umami
. The differing tastes are important for distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins.
[65]
As animals have
evolved
, the tastes that provide the most energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not enjoyable,
[66]
although humans in particular can acquire a preference for some substances which are initially unenjoyable.
[65]
Water, while important for survival, has no taste.
[67]
Sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as
glucose
or
fructose
, or
disaccharides
such as
sucrose
, a molecule combining glucose and fructose.
[68]
Sourness is caused by
acids
, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include citrus, specifically lemons and
limes
. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it can signal a food that may have gone
rancid
due to bacteria.
[69]
Saltiness is the taste of
alkali metal
ions
such as
sodium
and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor. Bitter taste is a sensation considered unpleasant characterised by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened dark chocolate,
caffeine
, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter. Umami, commonly described as savory, is a marker of proteins and characteristic of broths and cooked meats.
[70]
Foods that have a strong umami flavor include cheese, meat and mushrooms.
[71]
Catfish have millions of taste buds covering their entire body.
While most animals taste buds are located in their mouth, some insects taste receptors are located on their legs and some fish have taste buds along their entire body.
[72]
[73]
Dogs, cats and birds have relatively few taste buds (chickens have about 30),
[74]
adult humans have between 2000 and 4000,
[75]
while
catfish
can have more than a million.
[73]
Herbivores generally have more than carnivores as they need to tell which plants may be poisonous.
[74]
Not all
mammals
share the same tastes: some
rodents
can taste
starch
, cats cannot taste sweetness, and several
carnivores
(including
hyenas
, dolphins, and sea lions) have lost the ability to sense up to four of the five taste modalities found in humans.
[76]
Digestion
Main article:
Digestion
Food is broken into nutrient components through digestive process.
[77]
Proper digestion consists of mechanical processes (
chewing
,
peristalsis
) and chemical processes (
digestive enzymes
and
microorganisms
).
[78]
[79]
The digestive systems of herbivores and carnivores are very different as plant matter is harder to digest. Carnivores mouths are designed for tearing and biting compared to the grinding action found in herbivores.
[80]
Herbivores however have comparatively longer digestive tracts and larger stomachs to aid in digesting the cellulose in plants.
[81]
[82]
Food safety
Main article:
Food safety
According to the
World Health Organization
(WHO), about 600 million people worldwide get sick and 420,000 die each year from eating contaminated food.
[83]
[84]
Diarrhea
is the most common illness caused by consuming contaminated food, with about 550 million cases and 230,000 deaths from diarrhea each year. Children under 5 years of age account for 40% of the burden of foodborne illness, with 125,000 deaths each year.
[84]
[85]
A 2003
World Health Organization
(WHO) report concluded that about 30% of reported
food poisoning
outbreaks in the WHO European Region occur in private homes.
[86]
According to the WHO and
CDC
, in the USA alone, annually, there are 76 million cases of foodborne illness leading to 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.
[87]
From 2011 to 2016, on average, there were 668,673 cases of foodborne illness and 21 deaths each year.
[88]
[89]
[90]
[91]
In addition, during this period, 1,007 food poisoning outbreaks with 30,395 cases of food poisoning were reported.
[84]
In
Vietnam
, from 2011 to 2016, there were 7 foodborne diseases reported with 4,012,038 cases of illness, including 123 deaths.

Kevin Slavin hosts a conversation with food artist, educator, and entrepreneur Emilie Baltz, professor Caleb Harper from
MIT Media Lab's
CityFarm project, the Barbarian Group's Benjamin Palmer, and Andras Forgacs, the co-founder and CEO of
Modern Meadow
, who is growing 'victimless' meat in a lab. The discussion addresses issues of sustainable
urban farming
, ecosystems, technology, food supply chains and their broad environmental and humanitarian implications, and how these changes in food production may change what people may find delicious ... and the other way around."  Posted on the official YouTube Channel of
