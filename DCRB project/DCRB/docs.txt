free encyclopedia Substances consumed for nutrition This article is about food for all organisms For food for humans see Human food For other uses see Food disambiguation Foodstuffs redirects here For the New Zealand grocery company see Foodstuffs company Display of various foods Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support Food is usually of plant animal or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates fats proteins vitamins or minerals The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism s cells to provide energy maintain life or stimulate growth Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change accounting for as much as  of total greenhouse gas emissions The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including sustainability biological diversity economics population growth water supply and food security Food safety and security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection the World Resources Institute the World Food Programme the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Food Information Council Definition and classification A typical aquatic food web Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism It can be raw processed or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth health or pleasure Food is mainly composed of water lipids proteins and carbohydrates Minerals e g salts and organic substances e g vitamins can also be found in food Plants algae and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some of their own nutrients Water is found in many foods and has been defined as a food by itself Water and fiber have low energy densities or calories while fat is the most energy dense component Some inorganic non food elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning Human food can be classified in various ways either by related content or by how it is processed The number and composition of food groups can vary Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin and relative nutritional function Vegetables and Fruit Cereals and Bread Dairy and Meat Studies that look into diet quality group food into whole grains cereals refined grains cereals vegetables fruits nuts legumes eggs dairy products fish red meat processed meat and sugar sweetened beverages The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization use a system with nineteen food classifications cereals roots pulses and nuts milk eggs fish and shellfish meat insects vegetables fruits fats and oils sweets and sugars spices and condiments beverages foods for nutritional uses food additives composite dishes and savoury snacks Food sources Haber Bosch reactors like this produce most of the planet s fixed nitrogen a requirement for life primary reformer air feed secondary reformer CO conversion washing tower ammonia reactor heat exchanger ammonia condenser In a given ecosystem food forms a web of interlocking chains with primary producers at the bottom and apex predators at the top Other aspects of the web include detrovores that eat detritis and decomposers that break down dead organisms Primary producers include algae plants bacteria and protists that acquire their energy from sunlight Primary consumers are the herbivores that consume the plants and secondary consumers are the carnivores that consume those herbivores Some organisms including most mammals and birds diet consists of both animals and plants and they are considered omnivores The chain ends with the apex predators the animals that have no known predators in its ecosystem Humans are considered apex predators Humans are omnivores finding sustenance in vegetables fruits cooked meat milk eggs mushrooms and seaweed Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop Corn maize wheat and rice account for  of all grain production worldwide Just over half of the world s crops are used to feed humans  percent with  percent grown as animal feed and  percent for biofuels Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of fermented foods like bread wine cheese and yogurt Bacteria Without bacteria life would scarcely exist because bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into nutritious ammonia Ammonia is the precursor to proteins nucleic acids and most vitamins Since the advent of industrial process for nitrogen fixation the Haber Bosch Process the majority of ammonia in the world is human made Plants Foods from plant sources Photosynthesis is the source of most energy and food for nearly all life on earth Photosynthesis is one main source of biomass the food for plants algae and certain bacteria and indirectly organisms higher in the food chain Energy from the sun is absorbed and used to transform water and carbon dioxide in the air or soil into oxygen and glucose The oxygen is then released and the glucose stored as an energy reserve Plants also absorb important nutrients and minerals from the air natural waters and soil Carbon oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air or water and are the basic nutrients needed for plant survival The three main nutrients absorbed from the soil for plant growth are nitrogen phosphorus and potassium with other important nutrients including calcium sulfur magnesium iron boron chlorine manganese zinc copper molybdenum and nickel Plants as a food source are divided into seeds fruits vegetables legumes grains and nuts Where plants fall within these categories can vary with botanically described fruits such as the tomato squash pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue so seeds nuts and grains are technically fruit From a culinary perspective fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains nuts seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest with cereal grains oats wheat rice corn barley rye sorghum and millet belonging to the Poaceae grass family and pulses coming from the Fabaceae legume family Whole grains are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed bran germ and endosperm Nuts are dry fruits distinguishable by their woody shell Fleshy fruits distinguishable from dry fruits like grain seeds and nuts can be further classified as stone fruits cherries and peaches pome fruits apples pears berries blackberry strawberry citrus oranges lemon melons watermelon cantaloupe Mediterranean fruits grapes fig tropical fruits banana pineapple Vegetables refer to any other part of the plant that can be eaten including roots stems leaves flowers bark or the entire plant itself These include root vegetables potatoes and carrots bulbs onion family flowers cauliflower and broccoli leaf vegetables spinach and lettuce and stem vegetables celery and asparagus The carbohydrate protein and lipid content of plants is highly variable Carbohydrates are mainly in the form of starch fructose glucose and other sugars Most vitamins are found from plant sources with exceptions of vitamin D and vitamin B Minerals can also be plentiful or not Fruit can consist of up to  water contain high levels of simple sugars that contribute to their sweet taste and have a high vitamin C content Compared to fleshy fruit excepting Bananas vegetables are high in starch potassium dietary fiber folate and vitamins and low in fat and calories Grains are more starch based and nuts have a high protein fibre vitamin E and B content Seeds are a good source of food for animals because they are abundant and contain fibre and healthful fats such as omega  fats Complicated chemical interactions can enhance or depress bioavailability of certain nutrients Phytates can prevent the release of some sugars and vitamins Animals that only eat plants are called herbivores with those that mostly just eat fruits known as frugivores leaves while shoot eaters are folivores pandas and wood eaters termed xylophages termites Frugivores include a diverse range of species from annelids to elephants chimpanzees and many birds About  fish consume seeds or fruit Animals domesticated and wild use as many types of grasses that have adapted to different locations as their main source of nutrients Humans eat thousands of plant species there may be as many as   edible species of angiosperms of which perhaps   are often eaten Plants can be processed into breads pasta cereals juices and jams or raw ingredients such as sugar herbs spices and oils can be extracted Oilseeds are pressed to produce rich oils sunflower flaxseed rapeseed including canola oil and sesame Many plants and animals have coevolved in such a way that the fruit is a good source of nutrition to the animal who then excretes the seeds some distance away allowing greater dispersal Even seed predation can be mutually beneficial as some seeds can survive the digestion process Insects are major eaters of seeds with ants being the only real seed dispersers Birds although being major dispersers only rarely eat seeds as a source of food and can be identified by their thick beak that is used to crack open the seed coat Mammals eat a more diverse range of seeds as they are able to crush harder and larger seeds with their teeth Animals Various raw meats Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly This includes meat eggs shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese They are an important source of protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs One  ounce  g steak chicken breast or pork chop contains about  grams of protein One large egg has  grams of protein A  ounce  g serving of cheese has about  grams of protein And  cup of milk has about  grams of protein Other nutrients found in animal products include calories fat essential vitamins including B and minerals including zinc iron calcium magnesium Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products cheese butter etc Eggs laid by birds and other animals are eaten and bees produce honey a reduced nectar from flowers that is used as a popular sweetener in many cultures Some cultures consume blood such as in blood sausage as a thickener for sauces or in a cured salted form for times of food scarcity and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare Taste Main article Taste Animals specifically humans typically have five different types of tastes sweet sour salty bitter and umami The differing tastes are important for distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins As animals have evolved the tastes that provide the most energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not enjoyable although humans in particular can acquire a preference for some substances which are initially unenjoyable Water while important for survival has no taste Sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose or disaccharides such as sucrose a molecule combining glucose and fructose Sourness is caused by acids such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages Sour foods include citrus specifically lemons and limes Sour is evolutionarily significant as it can signal a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor Bitter taste is a sensation considered unpleasant characterised by having a sharp pungent taste Unsweetened dark chocolate caffeine lemon rind and some types of fruit are known to be bitter Umami commonly described as savory is a marker of proteins and characteristic of broths and cooked meats Foods that have a strong umami flavor include cheese meat and mushrooms Catfish have millions of taste buds covering their entire body While most animals taste buds are located in their mouth some insects taste receptors are located on their legs and some fish have taste buds along their entire body Dogs cats and birds have relatively few taste buds chickens have about  adult humans have between  and  while catfish can have more than a million Herbivores generally have more than carnivores as they need to tell which plants may be poisonous Not all mammals share the same tastes some rodents can taste starch cats cannot taste sweetness and several carnivores including hyenas dolphins and sea lions have lost the ability to sense up to four of the five taste modalities found in humans Digestion Main article Digestion Food is broken into nutrient components through digestive process Proper digestion consists of mechanical processes chewing peristalsis and chemical processes digestive enzymes and microorganisms The digestive systems of herbivores and carnivores are very different as plant matter is harder to digest Carnivores mouths are designed for tearing and biting compared to the grinding action found in herbivores Herbivores however have comparatively longer digestive tracts and larger stomachs to aid in digesting the cellulose in plants Food safety Main article Food safety According to the World Health Organization WHO about  million people worldwide get sick and   die each year from eating contaminated food Diarrhea is the most common illness caused by consuming contaminated food with about  million cases and   deaths from diarrhea each year Children under  years of age account for  of the burden of foodborne illness with   deaths each year A  World Health Organization WHO report concluded that about  of reported food poisoning outbreaks in the WHO European Region occur in private homes According to the WHO and CDC in the USA alone annually there are  million cases of foodborne illness leading to   hospitalizations and   deaths From  to  on average there were   cases of foodborne illness and  deaths each year In addition during this period   food poisoning outbreaks with   cases of food poisoning were reported In Vietnam from  to  there were  foodborne diseases reported with    cases of illness including  deaths See also Food portal Food pairing

free encyclopedia Substances consumed for nutrition mw parser output hatnote mw parser output div hatnote mw parser output hatnote i mw parser output hatnote link hatnoteThis article is about food for all organisms For food for humans see Human food For other uses see Food Foodstuffs redirects here For the New Zealand grocery company see Foodstuffs Display of various foods Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support Food is usually of plant animal or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates fats proteins vitamins or minerals The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism s cells to provide energy maintain life or stimulate growth Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change accounting for as much as  of total greenhouse gas emissions The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including sustainability biological diversity economics population growth water supply and food security Food safety and security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection the World Resources Institute the World Food Programme the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Food Information Council Definition and classification A typical aquatic food web Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism It can be raw processed or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth health or pleasure Food is mainly composed of water lipids proteins and carbohydrates Minerals and organic substances can also be found in food Plants algae and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some of their own nutrients Water is found in many foods and has been defined as a food by itself Water and fiber have low energy densities or calories while fat is the most energy dense component Some inorganic elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning Human food can be classified in various ways either by related content or by how it is processed The number and composition of food groups can vary Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin and relative nutritional function Vegetables and Fruit Cereals and Bread Dairy and Meat Studies that look into diet quality group food into whole grains cereals refined grains cereals vegetables fruits nuts legumes eggs dairy products fish red meat processed meat and sugar sweetened beverages The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization use a system with nineteen food classifications cereals roots pulses and nuts milk eggs fish and shellfish meat insects vegetables fruits fats and oils sweets and sugars spices and condiments beverages foods for nutritional uses food additives composite dishes and savoury snacks Food sources Haber Bosch reactors like this produce most of the planet s fixed nitrogen a requirement for life primary reformer air feed secondary reformer CO conversion washing tower ammonia reactor heat exchanger ammonia condenser In a given ecosystem food forms a web of interlocking chains with primary producers at the bottom and apex predators at the top Other aspects of the web include detrovores and decomposers Primary producers include algae plants bacteria and protists that acquire their energy from sunlight Primary consumers are the herbivores that consume the plants and secondary consumers are the carnivores that consume those herbivores Some organisms including most mammals and birds diet consists of both animals and plants and they are considered omnivores The chain ends with the apex predators the animals that have no known predators in its ecosystem Humans are considered apex predators Humans are omnivores finding sustenance in vegetables fruits cooked meat milk eggs mushrooms and seaweed Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop Corn wheat and rice account for  of all grain production worldwide Just over half of the world s crops are used to feed humans with  percent grown as animal feed and  percent for biofuels Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of fermented foods like bread wine cheese and yogurt Bacteria Without bacteria life would scarcely exist because bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into nutritious ammonia Ammonia is the precursor to proteins nucleic acids and most vitamins Since the advent of industrial process for nitrogen fixation the Haber Bosch Process the majority of ammonia in the world is human made Plants Foods from plant sources Photosynthesis is the source of most energy and food for nearly all life on earth Photosynthesis is one main source of biomass the food for plants algae and certain bacteria and indirectly organisms higher in the food chain Energy from the sun is absorbed and used to transform water and carbon dioxide in the air or soil into oxygen and glucose The oxygen is then released and the glucose stored as an energy reserve Plants also absorb important nutrients and minerals from the air natural waters and soil Carbon oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air or water and are the basic nutrients needed for plant survival The three main nutrients absorbed from the soil for plant growth are nitrogen phosphorus and potassium with other important nutrients including calcium sulfur magnesium iron boron chlorine manganese zinc copper molybdenum and nickel Plants as a food source are divided into seeds fruits vegetables legumes grains and nuts Where plants fall within these categories can vary with botanically described fruits such as the tomato squash pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue so seeds nuts and grains are technically fruit From a culinary perspective fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains nuts seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest with cereal grains belonging to the Poaceae family and pulses coming from the Fabaceae family Whole grains are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed Nuts are dry fruits distinguishable by their woody shell Fleshy fruits can be further classified as stone fruits pome fruits berries citrus melons Mediterranean fruits tropical fruits Vegetables refer to any other part of the plant that can be eaten including roots stems leaves flowers bark or the entire plant itself These include root vegetables bulbs flowers leaf vegetables and stem vegetables The carbohydrate protein and lipid content of plants is highly variable Carbohydrates are mainly in the form of starch fructose glucose and other sugars Most vitamins are found from plant sources with exceptions of vitamin D and vitamin B Minerals can also be plentiful or not Fruit can consist of up to  water contain high levels of simple sugars that contribute to their sweet taste and have a high vitamin C content Compared to fleshy fruit vegetables are high in starch potassium dietary fiber folate and vitamins and low in fat and calories Grains are more starch based and nuts have a high protein fibre vitamin E and B content Seeds are a good source of food for animals because they are abundant and contain fibre and healthful fats such as omega  fats Complicated chemical interactions can enhance or depress bioavailability of certain nutrients Phytates can prevent the release of some sugars and vitamins Animals that only eat plants are called herbivores with those that mostly just eat fruits known as frugivores leaves while shoot eaters are folivores and wood eaters termed xylophages Frugivores include a diverse range of species from annelids to elephants chimpanzees and many birds About  fish consume seeds or fruit Animals use as many types of grasses that have adapted to different locations as their main source of nutrients Humans eat thousands of plant species there may be as many as   edible species of angiosperms of which perhaps   are often eaten Plants can be processed into breads pasta cereals juices and jams or raw ingredients such as sugar herbs spices and oils can be extracted Oilseeds are pressed to produce rich oils sunflower flaxseed rapeseed and sesame Many plants and animals have coevolved in such a way that the fruit is a good source of nutrition to the animal who then excretes the seeds some distance away allowing greater dispersal Even seed predation can be mutually beneficial as some seeds can survive the digestion process Insects are major eaters of seeds with ants being the only real seed dispersers Birds although being major dispersers only rarely eat seeds as a source of food and can be identified by their thick beak that is used to crack open the seed coat Mammals eat a more diverse range of seeds as they are able to crush harder and larger seeds with their teeth Animals Various raw meats Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly This includes meat eggs shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese They are an important source of protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs One  ounce steak chicken breast or pork chop contains about  grams of protein One large egg has  grams of protein A  ounce serving of cheese has about  grams of protein And  cup of milk has about  grams of protein Other nutrients found in animal products include calories fat essential vitamins and minerals Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products Eggs laid by birds and other animals are eaten and bees produce honey a reduced nectar from flowers that is used as a popular sweetener in many cultures Some cultures consume blood such as in blood sausage as a thickener for sauces or in a cured salted form for times of food scarcity and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare Taste Main article Taste Animals specifically humans typically have five different types of tastes sweet sour salty bitter and umami The differing tastes are important for distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins As animals have evolved the tastes that provide the most energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not enjoyable although humans in particular can acquire a preference for some substances which are initially unenjoyable Water while important for survival has no taste Sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose or disaccharides such as sucrose a molecule combining glucose and fructose Sourness is caused by acids such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages Sour foods include citrus specifically lemons and limes Sour is evolutionarily significant as it can signal a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor Bitter taste is a sensation considered unpleasant characterised by having a sharp pungent taste Unsweetened dark chocolate caffeine lemon rind and some types of fruit are known to be bitter Umami commonly described as savory is a marker of proteins and characteristic of broths and cooked meats Foods that have a strong umami flavor include cheese meat and mushrooms Catfish have millions of taste buds covering their entire body While most animals taste buds are located in their mouth some insects taste receptors are located on their legs and some fish have taste buds along their entire body Dogs cats and birds have relatively few taste buds adult humans have between  and  while catfish can have more than a million Herbivores generally have more than carnivores as they need to tell which plants may be poisonous Not all mammals share the same tastes some rodents can taste starch cats cannot taste sweetness and several carnivores have lost the ability to sense up to four of the five taste modalities found in humans Digestion Main article Digestion Food is broken into nutrient components through digestive process Proper digestion consists of mechanical processes and chemical processes The digestive systems of herbivores and carnivores are very different as plant matter is harder to digest Carnivores mouths are designed for tearing and biting compared to the grinding action found in herbivores Herbivores however have comparatively longer digestive tracts and larger stomachs to aid in digesting the cellulose in plants Food safety Main article Food safety According to the World Health Organization about  million people worldwide get sick and   die each year from eating contaminated food Diarrhea is the most common illness caused by consuming contaminated food with about  million cases and   deaths from diarrhea each year Children under  years of age account for  of the burden of foodborne illness with   deaths each year A  World Health Organization report concluded that about  of reported food poisoning outbreaks in the WHO European Region occur in private homes According to the WHO and CDC in the USA alone annually there are  million cases of foodborne illness leading to   hospitalizations and   deaths From  to  on average there were   cases of foodborne illness and  deaths each year In addition during this period   food poisoning outbreaks with   cases of food poisoning were reported In Vietnam from  to  there were  foodborne diseases reported with    cases of illness including  deaths See also mw parser output

see Human food For other uses see Food disambiguation Foodstuffs redirects here For the New Zealand grocery company see Foodstuffs company Display of various foods Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support Food is usually of plant animal or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates fats proteins vitamins or minerals The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism s cells to provide energy maintain life or stimulate growth Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change accounting for as much as  of total greenhouse gas emissions The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including sustainability biological diversity economics population growth water supply and food security Food safety and security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection the World Resources Institute the World Food Programme the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Food Information Council Definition and classification A typical aquatic food web Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism It can be raw processed or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth health or pleasure Food is mainly composed of water lipids proteins and carbohydrates Minerals e g salts and organic substances e g vitamins can also be found in food Plants algae and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some of their own nutrients Water is found in many foods and has been defined as a food by itself Water and fiber have low energy densities or calories while fat is the most energy dense component Some inorganic non food elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning Human food can be classified in various ways either by related content or by how it is processed The number and composition of food groups can vary Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin and relative nutritional function Vegetables and Fruit Cereals and Bread Dairy and Meat Studies that look into diet quality group food into whole grains cereals refined grains cereals vegetables fruits nuts legumes eggs dairy products fish red meat processed meat and sugar sweetened beverages The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization use a system with nineteen food classifications cereals roots pulses and nuts milk eggs fish and shellfish meat insects vegetables fruits fats and oils sweets and sugars spices and condiments beverages foods for nutritional uses food additives composite dishes and savoury snacks Food sources Haber Bosch reactors like this produce most of the planet s fixed nitrogen a requirement for life primary reformer air feed secondary reformer CO conversion washing tower ammonia reactor heat exchanger ammonia condenser In a given ecosystem food forms a web of interlocking chains with primary producers at the bottom and apex predators at the top Other aspects of the web include detrovores that eat detritis and decomposers that break down dead organisms Primary producers include algae plants bacteria and protists that acquire their energy from sunlight Primary consumers are the herbivores that consume the plants and secondary consumers are the carnivores that consume those herbivores Some organisms including most mammals and birds diet consists of both animals and plants and they are considered omnivores The chain ends with the apex predators the animals that have no known predators in its ecosystem Humans are considered apex predators Humans are omnivores finding sustenance in vegetables fruits cooked meat milk eggs mushrooms and seaweed Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop Corn maize wheat and rice account for  of all grain production worldwide Just over half of the world s crops are used to feed humans  percent with  percent grown as animal feed and  percent for biofuels Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of fermented foods like bread wine cheese and yogurt Bacteria Without bacteria life would scarcely exist because bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into nutritious ammonia Ammonia is the precursor to proteins nucleic acids and most vitamins Since the advent of industrial process for nitrogen fixation the Haber Bosch Process the majority of ammonia in the world is human made Plants Foods from plant sources Photosynthesis is the source of most energy and food for nearly all life on earth Photosynthesis is one main source of biomass the food for plants algae and certain bacteria and indirectly organisms higher in the food chain Energy from the sun is absorbed and used to transform water and carbon dioxide in the air or soil into oxygen and glucose The oxygen is then released and the glucose stored as an energy reserve Plants also absorb important nutrients and minerals from the air natural waters and soil Carbon oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air or water and are the basic nutrients needed for plant survival The three main nutrients absorbed from the soil for plant growth are nitrogen phosphorus and potassium with other important nutrients including calcium sulfur magnesium iron boron chlorine manganese zinc copper molybdenum and nickel Plants as a food source are divided into seeds fruits vegetables legumes grains and nuts Where plants fall within these categories can vary with botanically described fruits such as the tomato squash pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue so seeds nuts and grains are technically fruit From a culinary perspective fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains nuts seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest with cereal grains oats wheat rice corn barley rye sorghum and millet belonging to the Poaceae grass family and pulses coming from the Fabaceae legume family Whole grains are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed bran germ and endosperm Nuts are dry fruits distinguishable by their woody shell Fleshy fruits distinguishable from dry fruits like grain seeds and nuts can be further classified as stone fruits cherries and peaches pome fruits apples pears berries blackberry strawberry citrus oranges lemon melons watermelon cantaloupe Mediterranean fruits grapes fig tropical fruits banana pineapple Vegetables refer to any other part of the plant that can be eaten including roots stems leaves flowers bark or the entire plant itself These include root vegetables potatoes and carrots bulbs onion family flowers cauliflower and broccoli leaf vegetables spinach and lettuce and stem vegetables celery and asparagus The carbohydrate protein and lipid content of plants is highly variable Carbohydrates are mainly in the form of starch fructose glucose and other sugars Most vitamins are found from plant sources with exceptions of vitamin D and vitamin B  Minerals can also be plentiful or not Fruit can consist of up to  water contain high levels of simple sugars that contribute to their sweet taste and have a high vitamin C content Compared to fleshy fruit excepting Bananas vegetables are high in starch potassium dietary fiber folate and vitamins and low in fat and calories Grains are more starch based and nuts have a high protein fibre vitamin E and B content Seeds are a good source of food for animals because they are abundant and contain fibre and healthful fats such as omega  fats Complicated chemical interactions can enhance or depress bioavailability of certain nutrients Phytates can prevent the release of some sugars and vitamins Animals that only eat plants are called herbivores with those that mostly just eat fruits known as frugivores leaves while shoot eaters are folivores pandas and wood eaters termed xylophages termites Frugivores include a diverse range of species from annelids to elephants chimpanzees and many birds About  fish consume seeds or fruit Animals domesticated and wild use as many types of grasses that have adapted to different locations as their main source of nutrients Humans eat thousands of plant species there may be as many as   edible species of angiosperms of which perhaps   are often eaten Plants can be processed into breads pasta cereals juices and jams or raw ingredients such as sugar herbs spices and oils can be extracted Oilseeds are pressed to produce rich oils sunflower flaxseed rapeseed including canola oil and sesame Many plants and animals have coevolved in such a way that the fruit is a good source of nutrition to the animal who then excretes the seeds some distance away allowing greater dispersal Even seed predation can be mutually beneficial as some seeds can survive the digestion process Insects are major eaters of seeds with ants being the only real seed dispersers Birds although being major dispersers only rarely eat seeds as a source of food and can be identified by their thick beak that is used to crack open the seed coat Mammals eat a more diverse range of seeds as they are able to crush harder and larger seeds with their teeth Animals Various raw meats Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly This includes meat eggs shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese They are an important source of protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs One  ounce  g steak chicken breast or pork chop contains about  grams of protein One large egg has  grams of protein A  ounce  g serving of cheese has about  grams of protein And  cup of milk has about  grams of protein Other nutrients found in animal products include calories fat essential vitamins including B and minerals including zinc iron calcium magnesium Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products cheese butter etc Eggs laid by birds and other animals are eaten and bees produce honey a reduced nectar from flowers that is used as a popular sweetener in many cultures Some cultures consume blood such as in blood sausage as a thickener for sauces or in a cured salted form for times of food scarcity and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare Taste Main article Taste Animals specifically humans typically have five different types of tastes sweet sour salty bitter and umami The differing tastes are important for distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins As animals have evolved the tastes that provide the most energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not enjoyable although humans in particular can acquire a preference for some substances which are initially unenjoyable Water while important for survival has no taste Sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose or disaccharides such as sucrose a molecule combining glucose and fructose Sourness is caused by acids such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages Sour foods include citrus specifically lemons and limes Sour is evolutionarily significant as it can signal a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor Bitter taste is a sensation considered unpleasant characterised by having a sharp pungent taste Unsweetened dark chocolate caffeine lemon rind and some types of fruit are known to be bitter Umami commonly described as savory is a marker of proteins and characteristic of broths and cooked meats Foods that have a strong umami flavor include cheese meat and mushrooms Catfish have millions of taste buds covering their entire body While most animals taste buds are located in their mouth some insects taste receptors are located on their legs and some fish have taste buds along their entire body Dogs cats and birds have relatively few taste buds chickens have about  adult humans have between  and  while catfish can have more than a million Herbivores generally have more than carnivores as they need to tell which plants may be poisonous Not all mammals share the same tastes some rodents can taste starch cats cannot taste sweetness and several carnivores including hyenas dolphins and sea lions have lost the ability to sense up to four of the five taste modalities found in humans Digestion Main article Digestion Food is broken into nutrient components through digestive process Proper digestion consists of mechanical processes chewing peristalsis and chemical processes digestive enzymes and microorganisms The digestive systems of herbivores and carnivores are very different as plant matter is harder to digest Carnivores mouths are designed for tearing and biting compared to the grinding action found in

food from a communal plate in the center of the table They traditionally do not use forks or spoons instead they scoop up the food with pita or a thumb and two fingers In Arabic culture the left hand is considered unclean and even left handed people eat with the right hand A common exception however is that the left hand may hold a drinking glass when eating greasy food with the right It is proper etiquette to compliment the host on their food and hospitality and to try every plate on the table If a guest does not leave food on his plate the host generally fills it immediately Ramadan During Ramadan food consumption increases dramatically in Muslim communities Breaking the daily sunrise to sunset fast is a banquet with family and friends whereas public banquets are held by charities and other associations Cafes and pastry shops are open at night and the streets have a carnival atmosphere Many Muslims following Muhammad s reported example break their fast with a date followed by a variety of dishes Sweet pastries and puddings are always present on Ramadan nights The end of Ramadan is marked by Eid al Fitr featuring a great quantity and variety of sweets and pastries The other major Muslim feast is the four day Eid al Adha the Feast of the Sacrifice which occurs during Dhu al Hijjah the pilgrimage month An animal usually a sheep or goat is slaughtered in every household that can afford it great banquets are prepared and food is given to the poor Turkey Tea is usually served in curved glasses which are held by the lip to which water may be added A cup of tea may be refilled if it is less than half full An honored guest is expected to make a toast usually soon after the host does or at the end of the meal Forks spoons and knives are used Sometimes the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left presenting the British style Smoking may be acceptable between courses of a dinner In formal situations and with more traditionalist company the hosts sit at the head of the table with the honored guest next to them on the side of the table which is farthest from the door The honored guest is served first and then it s customary to serve from elder guests to younger with a bias in favour of men Diners do not begin eating until the oldest person at the table begins eating In some informal restaurants dishes are ordered when desired not all at once at the beginning of a meal At informal restaurants a table may be shared but diners are not required to converse Guests may be required to remove their shoes It is customary to say Afiyet olsun May what you eat bring well being before or after eating and to say Elinize sa lik Bless your hand a compliment for the manual i e hand labour involved in cooking to whoever prepared the meal after a meal Iraq The working people of Iraq choose to start the day off with kahi a food originated from Jewish Babylonian culture which is made of thin pastry dough Iran Iranian dishes and foods are known for being rice based and Iran has been popular for its wide rice production Dishes are typically served as savory or sweet rather than in courses In traditional Iranian restaurants a large low table lined with Persian rugs and with cushions around the sides is the setting for a meal Diners sit cross legged in a circle and food is served in the center eaten with cutlery on separate plates Tea is served in kamar baareek narrow waist glasses with sugar and Persian sweets When entertaining dinner guests at home it is seen as discourteous to serve just enough food so food is prepared in large quantities An important Persian practice is taarof ritual politeness where if a person is offered food or drink they will initially politely decline Only after the host has offered repeatedly it is accepted and that is to avoid appearing greedy Globalization In  Middle Eastern cuisine was reportedly one of the most popular and fastest growing ethnic cuisines in the US Dishes such as hummus and

free encyclopedia Substances consumed for nutrition This article is about food for all organisms For food for humans see Human food For other uses see Food disambiguation Foodstuffs redirects here For the New Zealand grocery company see Foodstuffs company Display of various foods Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support Food is usually of plant animal or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates fats proteins vitamins or minerals The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism s cells to provide energy maintain life or stimulate growth Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change accounting for as much as  of total greenhouse gas emissions The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including sustainability biological diversity economics population growth water supply and food security Food safety and security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection the World Resources Institute the World Food Programme the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Food Information Council Definition and classification A typical aquatic food web Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism It can be raw processed or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth health or pleasure Food is mainly composed of water lipids proteins and carbohydrates Minerals e g salts and organic substances e g vitamins can also be found in food Plants algae and some microorganisms use photosynthesis to make some of their own nutrients Water is found in many foods and has been defined as a food by itself Water and fiber have low energy densities or calories while fat is the most energy dense component Some inorganic non food elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning Human food can be classified in various ways either by related content or by how it is processed The number and composition of food groups can vary Most systems include four basic groups that describe their origin and relative nutritional function Vegetables and Fruit Cereals and Bread Dairy and Meat Studies that look into diet quality group food into whole grains cereals refined grains cereals vegetables fruits nuts legumes eggs dairy products fish red meat processed meat and sugar sweetened beverages The Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization use a system with nineteen food classifications cereals roots pulses and nuts milk eggs fish and shellfish meat insects vegetables fruits fats and oils sweets and sugars spices and condiments beverages foods for nutritional uses food additives composite dishes and savoury snacks Food sources Haber Bosch reactors like this produce most of the planet s fixed nitrogen a requirement for life primary reformer air feed secondary reformer CO conversion washing tower ammonia reactor heat exchanger ammonia condenser In a given ecosystem food forms a web of interlocking chains with primary producers at the bottom and apex predators at the top Other aspects of the web include detrovores that eat detritis and decomposers that break down dead organisms Primary producers include algae plants bacteria and protists that acquire their energy from sunlight Primary consumers are the herbivores that consume the plants and secondary consumers are the carnivores that consume those herbivores Some organisms including most mammals and birds diet consists of both animals and plants and they are considered omnivores The chain ends with the apex predators the animals that have no known predators in its ecosystem Humans are considered apex predators Humans are omnivores finding sustenance in vegetables fruits cooked meat milk eggs mushrooms and seaweed Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop Corn maize wheat and rice account for  of all grain production worldwide Just over half of the world s crops are used to feed humans  percent with  percent grown as animal feed and  percent for biofuels Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of fermented foods like bread wine cheese and yogurt Bacteria Without bacteria life would scarcely exist because bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into nutritious ammonia Ammonia is the precursor to proteins nucleic acids and most vitamins Since the advent of industrial process for nitrogen fixation the Haber Bosch Process the majority of ammonia in the world is human made Plants Foods from plant sources Photosynthesis is the source of most energy and food for nearly all life on earth Photosynthesis is one main source of biomass the food for plants algae and certain bacteria and indirectly organisms higher in the food chain Energy from the sun is absorbed and used to transform water and carbon dioxide in the air or soil into oxygen and glucose The oxygen is then released and the glucose stored as an energy reserve Plants also absorb important nutrients and minerals from the air natural waters and soil Carbon oxygen and hydrogen are absorbed from the air or water and are the basic nutrients needed for plant survival The three main nutrients absorbed from the soil for plant growth are nitrogen phosphorus and potassium with other important nutrients including calcium sulfur magnesium iron boron chlorine manganese zinc copper molybdenum and nickel Plants as a food source are divided into seeds fruits vegetables legumes grains and nuts Where plants fall within these categories can vary with botanically described fruits such as the tomato squash pepper and eggplant or seeds like peas commonly considered vegetables Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue so seeds nuts and grains are technically fruit From a culinary perspective fruits are generally considered the remains of botanically described fruits after grains nuts seeds and fruits used as vegetables are removed Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest with cereal grains oats wheat rice corn barley rye sorghum and millet belonging to the Poaceae grass family and pulses coming from the Fabaceae legume family Whole grains are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed bran germ and endosperm Nuts are dry fruits distinguishable by their woody shell Fleshy fruits distinguishable from dry fruits like grain seeds and nuts can be further classified as stone fruits cherries and peaches pome fruits apples pears berries blackberry strawberry citrus oranges lemon melons watermelon cantaloupe Mediterranean fruits grapes fig tropical fruits banana pineapple Vegetables refer to any other part of the plant that can be eaten including roots stems leaves flowers bark or the entire plant itself These include root vegetables potatoes and carrots bulbs onion family flowers cauliflower and broccoli leaf vegetables spinach and lettuce and stem vegetables celery and asparagus The carbohydrate protein and lipid content of plants is highly variable Carbohydrates are mainly in the form of starch fructose glucose and other sugars Most vitamins are found from plant sources with exceptions of vitamin D and vitamin B Minerals can also be plentiful or not Fruit can consist of up to  water contain high levels of simple sugars that contribute to their sweet taste and have a high vitamin C content Compared to fleshy fruit excepting Bananas vegetables are high in starch potassium dietary fiber folate and vitamins and low in fat and calories Grains are more starch based and nuts have a high protein fibre vitamin E and B content Seeds are a good source of food for animals because they are abundant and contain fibre and healthful fats such as omega  fats Complicated chemical interactions can enhance or depress bioavailability of certain nutrients Phytates can prevent the release of some sugars and vitamins Animals that only eat plants are called herbivores with those that mostly just eat fruits known as frugivores leaves while shoot eaters are folivores pandas and wood eaters termed xylophages termites Frugivores include a diverse range of species from annelids to elephants chimpanzees and many birds About  fish consume seeds or fruit Animals domesticated and wild use as many types of grasses that have adapted to different locations as their main source of nutrients Humans eat thousands of plant species there may be as many as   edible species of angiosperms of which perhaps   are often eaten Plants can be processed into breads pasta cereals juices and jams or raw ingredients such as sugar herbs spices and oils can be extracted Oilseeds are pressed to produce rich oils sunflower flaxseed rapeseed including canola oil and sesame Many plants and animals have coevolved in such a way that the fruit is a good source of nutrition to the animal who then excretes the seeds some distance away allowing greater dispersal Even seed predation can be mutually beneficial as some seeds can survive the digestion process Insects are major eaters of seeds with ants being the only real seed dispersers Birds although being major dispersers only rarely eat seeds as a source of food and can be identified by their thick beak that is used to crack open the seed coat Mammals eat a more diverse range of seeds as they are able to crush harder and larger seeds with their teeth Animals Various raw meats Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly This includes meat eggs shellfish and dairy products like milk and cheese They are an important source of protein and are considered complete proteins for human consumption as they contain all the essential amino acids that the human body needs One  ounce  g steak chicken breast or pork chop contains about  grams of protein One large egg has  grams of protein A  ounce  g serving of cheese has about  grams of protein And  cup of milk has about  grams of protein Other nutrients found in animal products include calories fat essential vitamins including B and minerals including zinc iron calcium magnesium Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products cheese butter etc Eggs laid by birds and other animals are eaten and bees produce honey a reduced nectar from flowers that is used as a popular sweetener in many cultures Some cultures consume blood such as in blood sausage as a thickener for sauces or in a cured salted form for times of food scarcity and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare Taste Main article Taste Animals specifically humans typically have five different types of tastes sweet sour salty bitter and umami The differing tastes are important for distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins As animals have evolved the tastes that provide the most energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not enjoyable although humans in particular can acquire a preference for some substances which are initially unenjoyable Water while important for survival has no taste Sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose or disaccharides such as sucrose a molecule combining glucose and fructose Sourness is caused by acids such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages Sour foods include citrus specifically lemons and limes Sour is evolutionarily significant as it can signal a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor Bitter taste is a sensation considered unpleasant characterised by having a sharp pungent taste Unsweetened dark chocolate caffeine lemon rind and some types of fruit are known to be bitter Umami commonly described as savory is a marker of proteins and characteristic of broths and cooked meats Foods that have a strong umami flavor include cheese meat and mushrooms Catfish have millions of taste buds covering their entire body While most animals taste buds are located in their mouth some insects taste receptors are located on their legs and some fish have taste buds along their entire body Dogs cats and birds have relatively few taste buds chickens have about  adult humans have between  and  while catfish can have more than a million Herbivores generally have more than carnivores as they need to tell which plants may be poisonous Not all mammals share the same tastes some rodents can taste starch cats cannot taste sweetness and several carnivores including hyenas dolphins and sea lions have lost the ability to sense up to four of the five taste modalities found in humans Digestion Main article Digestion Food is broken into nutrient components through digestive process Proper digestion consists of mechanical processes chewing peristalsis and chemical processes digestive enzymes and microorganisms The digestive systems of herbivores and carnivores are very different as plant matter is harder to digest Carnivores mouths are designed for tearing and biting compared to the grinding action found in herbivores Herbivores however have comparatively longer digestive tracts and larger stomachs to aid in digesting the cellulose in plants Food safety Main article Food safety According to the World Health Organization WHO about  million people worldwide get sick and   die each year from eating contaminated food Diarrhea is the most common illness caused by consuming contaminated food with about  million cases and   deaths from diarrhea each year Children under  years of age account for  of the burden of foodborne illness with   deaths each year A  World Health Organization WHO report concluded that about  of reported food poisoning outbreaks in the WHO European Region occur in private homes According to the WHO and CDC in the USA alone annually there are  million cases of foodborne illness leading to   hospitalizations and   deaths From  to  on average there were   cases of foodborne illness and  deaths each year In addition during this period   food poisoning outbreaks with   cases of food poisoning were reported In Vietnam from  to  there were  foodborne diseases reported with    cases of illness including  deaths See also Food portal Food pairing

heavy bodied cyprinid fishes are collectively known in the United States as Asian carp Cyprinids from the Indian subcontinent for example catla Catla catla and mrigal Cirrhinus cirrhosus are not included in this classification and are known collectively as Indian carp Asian carp are considered invasive species in the United States In June  the EPA funded initiative to rebrand Asian Carp as Copi was announced The new name Copi is a part of the Federal and multi state campaign to reintroduce the carps to the public as a healthy and responsible seafood option in order to decrease its numbers in U S waterways Species Ten Asian carp have been substantially introduced outside their native ranges Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella Common carp Cyprinus carpio Amur carp Cyprinus rubrofuscus Silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Largescale silver carp Hypophthalmichthys harmandi Bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis Black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus Goldfish Carassius auratus Crucian carp Carassius carassius Mud carp Cirrhinus molitorella All the above except largescale silver carp have been cultivated in aquaculture in China for over   years Largescale silver carp a more southern species is native to Vietnam and is cultivated there Grass silver bighead and black carp are known as the Four Domesticated Fish in China and are the most important freshwater fish species for food and traditional Chinese medicine Bighead and silver carp are the most important fish worldwide in terms of total aquaculture production Common carp amur carp and crucian carp are also common food fishes in China and elsewhere Goldfish though are cultivated mainly as pet fish Common carp are native to both Eastern Europe and Western Asia so they are sometimes called a Eurasian carp Asian carp swimming at a Koi pond inside the Jard n Bot nico de Quito In East Asian culture In Chinese culture Further information Fish in Chinese mythology A long tradition of Asian carp exists in Chinese culture and literature A popular lyric circulating as early as   years ago in the late Han period includes an anecdote which relates how a man far away from home sent back to his wife a pair of carp Chinese pinyin Liyu in which when the wife opened the fish to cook she found a silk strip that carried a love note of just two lines Eat well to keep fit missing you and forget me not At the Yellow River at Henan Chinese pinyin H n n Wade Giles Ho nan is a waterfall called the Dragon Gate It is said that if certain carp called yulong can climb the cataract they will transform into dragons Every year in the third month of spring they swim up from the sea and gather in vast numbers in the pool at the foot of the falls It used to be said that only  could make the climb in any year When the first succeeded then the rains would begin to fall This Dragon Gate was said to have been created after the flood by the god emperor Yu who split a mountain blocking the path of the Yellow River It was so famous that throughout China was a common saying a student facing his examinations is like a carp attempting to leap the Dragon Gate Henan is not the only place where this happens Many other waterfalls in China also have the name Dragon Gate and much the same is said about them Other famous Dragon Gates are on the Wei River where it passes through the Lung Sheu Mountains and at Tsin in Shanxi Province The fish s jumping feature is set in such a proverbial idiom as Liyu Carp jumps over the Dragon Gate Chinese an idiom that conveys a vivid image symbolizing a sudden uplifting in one s social status as when one ascends into the upper society or has found favor with the royal or a noble family perhaps through marriage but in particular through success in the imperial examination It is therefore an idiom often used to encourage students or children to achieve success through hard work and perseverance This symbolic image as well as the image of the carp itself has been one of the most popular themes in Chinese paintings especially those of popular styles The fish is usually colored in gold or pink shimmering with an unmistakably auspicious tone Yuquan Chinese one of the well known scenic spots in Hangzhou has a large fish pond alive with hundreds of carp of various colors A three character inscription Yu Le Guo Chinese meaning fish s paradise is set above one end of the pond in the calligraphy of a famous gentry scholar of the late Ming Dynasty named Dong Qichang Chinese Many tourists feed the fish with bread crumbs Among the various kinds of carp the silver carp is the least expensive in China The grass carp is still the main delicacy in Hangzhou cuisine Restaurants along the West Lake of the city keep the fish in cages submerged in the lake water right in front of the restaurant on an order from a customer they dash a live fish on the pavement to kill it before cooking The fish is normally served with a vinegar based sweet and sour sauce Chinese A traditional Japanese tattoo of Koi fish In Japanese culture The modern Japanese Koi fish are a brightly colored species of the Amur carp that have been bred by rice farmers in Japan since the early th century This subspecies of carp plays a significant role in Japanese art often being depicted as symbols of luck strength and tenacity For this reason Koi fish are also presented as gifts in Japanese culture as symbols of love gratitude and peace Their bright colors and unique patterns present a high degree of eloquence to the Japanese people thus creating a level of respect and appreciation for the Koi With Koi fish being at the forefront of a lot of Japanese art it is common to find modern depictions of Koi in paintings home art murals and even tattoos To many people Koi fish strongly represent Samurai warriors as they are able to be seen swimming upwards against a rivers current symbolizing a Samurai s bravery One typical saying is the phrase koi no taki nobori translating to Carp climbing the waterfalls a phrase that is used to describe a persons strength and perseverance Recreational fishing A common carp caught using the method of Fly fishing Of the species of Asian carp the common carp Cyprinus carpio grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella and black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus are popular targets for recreational fisherman in the Midwest despite their status of being an invasive species These species of Asian carp are unique because of their ability to be caught with the traditional fishing technique of using a fishing rod reel and a hook Other invasive carp species such as the Silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and the largescale silver carp Hypophthalmichthys harmandi are not traditionally caught on rod and reel because they feed on plankton therefore they do not bite on baited hooks or lures The subspecies of common carp in particular is one of the most abundant species of carp found in most rivers creeks lakes and ponds throughout the Midwest region of the United States Common carp are a particularly strong fish that fight hard on the end of anglers lines making them an appealing target for recreational fisherman Since its introduction to the waters of the United States in the s these fish have been viewed as a game fish despite the fact that they are a destructive and invasive species Jumping ability Common carp jumping up into the air Silver carp are easily frightened by boats which cause them to leap between     metres   ft into the air and numerous boaters have been severely injured by collisions with the fish According to the Environmental Protection Agency reported injuries include cuts from fins black eyes broken bones back injuries and concussions This behavior has sometimes been attributed to the very similar bighead carp but these do not normally jump when frightened Catching jumping carp in nets has become part of the Redneck Fishing Tournament in Bath Illinois As food Koikoku thick miso soup with carp Asian carp have been a popular food fish in Asia for thousands of years Some recipes are specifically for carp such as the sweet and sour carp Chinese pinyin T ngc L y and thick miso soup with carp Japanese romanized Koikoku However many people in North America do not distinguish the various Asian carp species and see them all as undesirable trash fish because of their perceived bottom feeding behavior while in fact only some species are bottom feeders Furthermore even the bottom feeding species such as the common carp a highly bony species which was introduced to North America from Europe in the th century are important food fish outside North America The pearly white flesh of carps though complicated by a series of fine bones is said to taste like cod or described as a cross between scallops and crabmeat The filter feeding silver and bighead carp in particular have much lower heavy metal contamination such as mercury than most other fish because they are algivorous primary consumers that do not eat other aquatic invertebrates or fishes and therefore are the least impacted by biomagnification Copi renaming In June  the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced a campaign to rebrand Asian carp as Copi The Copi renaming is a part of a Federal and state initiative to get the public to eat the invasive fish decrease its numbers in Midwestern waterways and prevent its introduction to the Great Lakes Logo for Copi the new name for Asian carp The Copi food truck at the  Illinois State Fair in Springfield Illinois The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative GLRI is funding the Copi rebrand of Asian carp Copi is available in restaurants in Illinois Arizona and Washington DC in  fish markets in Illinois and Tennessee and through  fish distributors in Illinois Michigan New York Ohio Maryland and Wisconsin Success of the Copi rebrand of the invasive fish will be measured using pounds of removal as the key metric Removal was projected to total    lbs at launch of the Copi rebrand and increase to    in the first year following Removal at  months from launch exceeded    lbs on pace to beat year  projections As an invasive species Some species of Asian carp cause harm when they are introduced to new environments The black carp feeds on native mussels and snails some of which are already endangered Grass carp can alter the food webs of a new environment by altering the communities of plants invertebrates and fish Silver carp feed on the plankton necessary for larval fish and native mussels North America Main article Asian carp in North America Because of their prominence and because they were imported to the United States much later than other carp native to Asia the term Asian carp is often used with the intended meaning of only grass black silver and bighead carp In the U S Asian carp are considered to be invasive species Of the Asian carp introduced to the United States only two crucian and black carp are not known to be firmly established Crucian carp is probably extirpated Since  however several adults fertile black carp have been captured from the Atchafalaya and other rivers connected to the Mississippi River Dr Leo Nico in the book Black carp Biological Synopsis and Risk Assessment of an Introduced Fish reports that black carp are probably established in the United States In South Florida the local water management district actually stocks the canals with sterilized grass carp to control the hydrilla plant which tends to block the locks and drainage valves used to control water flow from the Everglades Bighead and silver carp feed by filtering plankton from the water The extremely high abundance of bighead and silver carp has caused great concern because of the potential for competition with native species for food and living space Because of their filter feeding habits they are difficult to capture by normal angling methods History In the late th century the common carp was distributed widely throughout the United States by the United States Fish Commission as a foodfish In the s fish farmers in mostly southern states began importing Asian carp from China to help clean their commercial ponds The rise in the populations of bighead and silver carp has been dramatic where they are established in the Mississippi River basin Distribution Bighead silver and grass carp are known to be well established in the Mississippi River basin including tributaries where they at times reach extremely high numbers especially in the case of the bighead and silver carp Bighead silver and grass carp have been captured in that watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota Minnesota and Ohio Grass carp are also established in at least one other watershed in Texas and may be established elsewhere Asian carp Shedd Aquarium Chicago Grass carp have been captured in all of the Great Lakes except Lake Superior but so far no evidence indicates a reproducing population No silver carp or black carp have yet been found in any of the Great Lakes Common carp are abundant throughout the Great Lakes A few bighead and grass carp have been captured in Canada s portions of the Great Lakes but no Asian carp other than common carp is known to be established in Canada at this time Concerns exist that the silver carp may spread into Cypress Hills in Alberta and Saskatchewan through Battle Creek the Frenchman River and other rivers flowing south out of the hills into the Milk River Ontario does not have Asian carp yet and has used the provincial Invasive Species Act to prohibit their import In Mexico grass carp have been established for many years in at least two river systems where they are considered invasive but no other Asian carp are known to have been introduced Management These fish are thought to be highly detrimental to the environment in parts of the United States Because of these concerns the U S Fish and Wildlife Service convened stakeholders to develop a national plan for the management and control of invasive Asian carp referring to bighead silver black and grass carp The plan was accepted by the National Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force in the fall of  As of  efforts were being made to reintroduce alligator gar between Tennessee and Illinois as part of an effort to control Asian carp In  the Kentucky declared War on Carp and started to use electro fishing and sonic devices to remove  million pounds of Asian carp from Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake Electro fishing has become an extensive technique in population management of Asian carp throughout the Midwest s river systems It involves the use of electric waves that stun non lethally the invasive fish at the surface of the water where fisherman can then corral them into net and remove from the ecosystem Electro fishing is also safe for the native species of fish that cohabit the waters where it is implemented because they avoid the electro fishing boats by diving deeper into the water column where as the carp jump near the surface getting stunned in the process There have been conclusive results that have proven electro fishing to be an effective and efficient way to manage the Asian carp invasion in Midwestern waterways A typical electro fishing boat can shock  carp per minute of fishing utilizing   volts of electricity the fish captured are then humanely killed and used as food or fertilizer for crops However the technique has sparked questions about potential negative impacts that it may have on the rivers ecosystems If electro fishing boats go over spawning grounds for native fish it could potentially cause harm to fish embryos Legislation The Stop Asian Carp Act of  was introduced to require the Secretary of the Army to study the feasibility of the hydrological separation such as electric barriers of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins The act provided  days for the Secretary of the Army to begin a study on the best means of implementing a hydrological separation of the Great Lakes to prevent the introduction of Asian carp The study requirements included researching techniques that prevented the spread of carp from flooding wastewater and storm water infrastructure waterway safety operations and barge and recreational traffic In  the U S Senate and House introduced new bills aimed at combating the spread of Asian carp into the Great Lakes by expediting some items of the Stop Asian Carp Act of  The legislation provides direction to the U S Army Corps of Engineers to complete their study within  months on how to separate the Great Lakes from the Mississippi watersheds The Water Resources Development Act of  was passed by Congress to provide  million to efforts against the invasive species in the Tennessee and Cumberland river basins In April  a new extensive plan was created by the Invasive Carp Regional Coordinating Committee to launch over  projects to combat the growing Asian carp invasion in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest The committee is partnering with a collaboration of  U S and Canadian federal state provincial tribal regional and local agencies to work on new technologies and strategies to implement against Asian carp spreading to the Great Lakes The  Invasive Carp Action Plan includes the following The Brandon Road Project led by the U S Army Corps of Engineers to prevent carp from entering the Great Lakes by establishing structural and non structural control measures in Will County Illinois The Department of Natural Resources DNR is working with the committee to upgrade sections of the earthen berm at Little Killbuck Creek Ohio This location contains a hydraulic connection between the Mississippi River and the Lake Eire water sheds when the water is high This projects aims to close this aquatic pathway for the invasive species of carp and further prevent their spreading into Lake Erie Operating electric dispersal barriers in the Chicago Area Waterway System to include the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to Lake Michigan The U S army Corps of Engineers will also conduct experiments with new technologies in underwater acoustics and carbon dioxide deterrent barriers to prevent the migration of invasive carp into the Great Lakes region The Department of Natural Resources will also organize commercial fishing of the invasive carp species in the upper Illinois River to reduce the population and the risk of upstream expansion

Family Cyprinidae Subfamily Cyprininae Genus Cyprinus Species C carpio Binomial name Cyprinus carpioLinnaeus  native range introduced range Painting by Ellen Edmonson The Eurasian carp or European carp Cyprinus carpio widely known as the common carp is a widespread freshwater fish of eutrophic waters in lakes and large rivers in Europe and Asia The native wild populations are considered vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN but the species has also been domesticated and introduced see aquaculture into environments worldwide and is often considered a destructive invasive species being included in the list of the world s  worst invasive species It gives its name to the carp family Cyprinidae Taxonomy Common Carp by Alexander Francis Lydon The type subspecies is Cyprinus carpio carpio native to much of Europe notably the Danube and Volga rivers The subspecies Cyprinus carpio haematopterus Amur carp native to eastern Asia was recognized in the past but recent authorities treat it as a separate species under the name Cyprinus rubrofuscus The common carp and various Asian relatives in their pure forms can be separated by meristics and also differ in genetics but they are able to interbreed Common carp can also interbreed with the goldfish Carassius auratus the result is called Kollar carp Another artificial hybrid is Ghost Carp which is bred between common carp and Japanese Purachina Koi The large variation of colours produced makes ghost carp a popular commercial species History The common carp is native to Europe and Asia and has been introduced to every part of the world except the poles They are the third most frequently introduced fish species worldwide and their history as a farmed fish dates back to Roman times Carp are used as food in many areas but are also regarded as a pest in several regions due to their ability to out compete native fish stocks The original common carp was found in the inland delta of the Danube River about  years ago and was torpedo shaped and golden yellow in colour It had two pairs of barbels and a mesh like scale pattern Although this fish was initially kept as an exploited captive it was later maintained in large specially built ponds by the Romans in south central Europe verified by the discovery of common carp remains in excavated settlements in the Danube delta area As aquaculture became a profitable branch of agriculture efforts were made to farm the animals and the culture systems soon included spawning and growing ponds The common carp s native range also extends to the Black Sea Caspian Sea and Aral Sea Both European and Asian subspecies have been domesticated In Europe domestication of carp as food fish was spread by monks between the th and th centuries The wild forms of carp had already reached the delta of the Rhine in the th century probably with some human help Variants that have arisen with domestication include the mirror carp with large mirror like scales linear mirror scaleless except for a row of large scales that run along the lateral line originating in Germany the leather carp virtually unscaled except near dorsal fin and the fully scaled carp Koi carp nishikigoi in Japanese pinyin l y in Chinese is a domesticated ornamental variety that originated in the Niigata region of Japan in the s but its parent species are likely the East Asian carp possibly C rubrofuscus Physiology and life history Dutch wild carp The carp has a robust build with a dark gold sheen most prominent on its head Its body is adorned with large conspicuous scales that are very shiny It has large pectoral fins and a tapering dorsal fin running down the last two thirds of its body getting progressively higher as it nears the carp s head Its caudal and anal fins may either be a dark bronze or washed with a rubbery orange hue The mouth of the carp is downwards turned with two pairs of barbels the ones on the bottom being larger Wild common carp are typically slimmer than domesticated forms with body length about four times body height red flesh and a forward protruding mouth Common carp can grow to very large sizes if given adequate space and nutrients Their average growth rate by weight is about half the growth rate of domesticated carp They do not reach the lengths and weights of domesticated carp which range     times can grow to a maximum length of  centimetres  in a maximum weight of over  kilograms  lb The longest lived common carp documented was of wild origin in non native habitat of North America and was  years of age The largest recorded carp caught by British angler Colin Smith in  at Etang La Saussaie Fishery France weighed   kilograms   lb The average size of the common carp is around   cm   inches and   kg     lb The skeleton of a European carp European carp x ray Habitat Although tolerant of most conditions common carp prefer large bodies of slow or standing water and soft vegetative sediments As schooling fish they prefer to be in groups of five or more They naturally live in temperate climates in fresh or slightly brackish water with a pH of     and salinity up to about   and temperatures of  to  C   F The ideal temperature is  to  C   F with spawning beginning at  to  C   F they easily survive winter in a frozen over pond as long as some free water remains below the ice Carp are able to tolerate water with very low oxygen levels by gulping air at the surface Diet Common carp are omnivorous They can eat a herbivorous diet of aquatic plants plant tubers and seeds but prefer to scavenge the bottom for insects crustaceans including zooplankton and crawfish molluscs benthic worms fish eggs and fish remains Common carp feed throughout the day with the most intensive feeding at night and around sunrise Reproduction An egg layer a typical adult female can lay   eggs in a single spawn Although carp typically spawn in the spring in response to rising water temperatures and rainfall carp can spawn multiple times in a season In commercial operations spawning is often stimulated using a process called hypophysation where lyophilized pituitary extract is injected into the fish The pituitary extract contains gonadotropic hormones which stimulate gonad maturation and sex steroid production ultimately promoting reproduction Predation A single carp can lay over a million eggs in a year Eggs and fry often fall victim to bacteria fungi and the vast array of tiny predators in the pond environment Carp which survive to juvenile are preyed upon by other fish such as the northern pike and largemouth bass and several birds including cormorants herons goosanders and ospreys and mammals including otter and mink Introduction into other habitats Carp gather near a dock in Lake Powell Arizona Carp in the Maribyrnong River Australia Carp in the duck pond in Herbert Park Dublin Ireland Koi feeding The koi are ornamental varieties of domesticated carp and are kept in garden ponds Although the koi s parent species has been considered the common carp recent authorities believe it originates from an East Asian carp possibly C rubrofuscus Common carp have been introduced to most continents and some  countries In absence of natural predators or commercial fishing they may extensively alter their environments due to their reproductive rate and their feeding habit of grubbing through bottom sediments for food In feeding they may destroy uproot disturb and eat submerged vegetation causing serious damage to food sources and habitats of native duck such as canvasbacks and fish populations In  scientists demonstrated that a small proportion of fertilized common carp eggs ingested by waterfowl survive passing through the digestive tract and hatch after being retrieved from the feces Birds exhibit strong preference for fish eggs while cyprinids produce hundreds of thousands of eggs at a single spawning event These data indicate that despite the low proportion of eggs surviving the digestive tract of birds endozoochory might provide a potentially overlooked dispersal mechanism of invasive cyprinid fish If proven under natural circumstances endozoochorous dispersal of invasive fish could be a strong conservation concern for freshwater biodiversity Australia Carp were introduced to Australia over  years ago but were not seen as a recognised pest species until the Boolarra strain appeared in the s After spreading massively through the Murray Darling basin aided by massive flooding in  they have established themselves in every Australian territory except for the Northern Territory In Victoria the common carp has been declared a noxious fish species and the quantity a fisherman can take is unlimited In South Australia it is an offence for this species to be released back to the wild An Australian company produces plant fertilizer from carp Efforts to eradicate a small colony from Lake Crescent in Tasmania without using chemicals have been successful but the long term expensive and intensive undertaking is an example of both the possibility and difficulty of safely removing the species once it is established One proposal regarded as environmentally questionable is to control common carp numbers by deliberately exposing them to the carp specific koi herpes virus with its high mortality rate In  the Australian Government announced plans to release this virus into the Murray Darling basin in an attempt to reduce the number of invasive common carp in the water system However in  this plan was found to be unlikely to work The CSIRO has also developed a technique for genetically modifying carp so that they only produce male offspring This daughterless carp method shows promise for totally eradicating carp from Australia s waterways North America Common carp were brought to the United States in  In the late th century they were distributed widely throughout the country by the government as a food fish but they are now rarely eaten in the United States where they are generally considered pests As in Australia their introduction has been shown to have negative environmental consequences In Utah the common carp s population in Utah Lake is expected to be reduced by  percent by using nets to catch millions of them and either giving them to people who will eat them or processing them into fertilizer This in turn will give the declining population of the native June sucker a chance to recover Another method of control is to trap them with seine nets in tributaries they use to spawn and exposing them to the piscicide rotenone This method has been shown to reduce their impact within  hours and greatly increase native vegetation and desirable fish species It also allows native fish to prey more easily on young carp Common carp are thought to have been introduced into the Canadian province of British Columbia from the neighboring Washington state They were first noted in the Okanagan Valley in  as was their rapid growth in population Carp are currently distributed in the lower Columbia Arrow Lakes lower Kootenay Kettle Christina Lake and throughout the Okanagan system Common carp aquaculture Global Aquaculture Production of common carp in tonnes from  to  Common carp contributed around   million tons on a global scale during   roughly accounting for   of the total global inland fisheries production In Europe common carp contributed     Mt of the total inland fisheries production   Mt during   It is a major farmed species in European freshwater aquaculture with production localized in central and eastern European countries The Russian Federation   Mt followed by Poland   Mt Czech Republic   Mt Hungary   Mt and Ukraine   Mt represents about  of carp production in Europe during  In fact the land locked central European countries rely heavily on common carp aquaculture in fishponds The average productivity of carp culture systems in central European countries ranges between   and  ton ha  The European common carp production in terms of volume reached its peak   Mt during   and has been declining since Carp farming is often criticized as an anthropogenic driver of eutrophication of inland freshwater bodies especially in the Central Eastern European Region CEER There has been some debate between environmentalists and carp farmers concerning eutrophication of water bodies manifested into lobbying at ministry levels surrounding fishpond legislations European carp aquaculture in fish ponds most likely has the least nutrient

Hungarian fisherman s soup a specially prepared fish soup of carp alone or mixed with other freshwater fish is part of the traditional meal for Christmas Eve in Hungary along with stuffed cabbage and poppy seed roll and walnut roll A traditional Czech Christmas Eve dinner is a thick soup of carp s head and offal fried carp meat sometimes the meat is skinned and baked instead with potato salad or boiled carp in black sauce A Slovak Christmas Eve dinner is quite similar with soup varying according to the region and fried carp as the main dish Also in Austria parts of Germany and Poland a fried carp is one of the traditional dishes on Christmas Eve In Western Europe the carp is cultivated more commonly as a sport fish although there is a small market for it as a food fish Carp are mixed with other common fish to make gefilte fish popular in Jewish cuisine Common carp are extremely popular with anglers in many parts of Europe and their popularity as quarry is slowly increasing among anglers in the United States though they are still generally considered pests and destroyed in most areas of the U S and southern Canada Carp are also popular with spear bow and fly fishermen In the United States carp is mostly ignored as a food fish Almost all U S shoppers bypass carp due to a preference for filleted fish as opposed to cooking whole Carp have smaller intramuscular bones called y bones which makes them a whole fish species for cooking The Romans farmed carp and this pond culture continued through the monasteries of Europe and to this day In China Korea and Japan carp farming

Commons From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Raising fish commercially in enclosures A fish farm on the coast of Euboea island in South Euboean Gulf Greece Fish farming or pisciculture involves commercial breeding of fish most often for food in fish tanks or artificial enclosures such as fish ponds It is a particular type of aquaculture which is the controlled cultivation and harvesting of aquatic animals such as fish crustaceans molluscs and so on in natural or pseudo natural environments A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery Worldwide the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp catfish salmon and tilapia Global demand is increasing for dietary fish protein which has resulted in widespread overfishing in wild fisheries resulting in significant decrease in fish stocks and even complete depletion in some regions Fish farming allows establishment of artificial fish colonies that are provided with sufficient feeding protection from natural predators and competitive threats access to veterinarian service and easier harvesting when needed while being separate from and thus do not usually impact the sustainable yields of wild fish populations While fish farming is practised worldwide China alone provides  of the world s farmed fish production As of  more than  of seafood was produced by aquaculture In the last three decades aquaculture has been the main driver of the increase in fisheries and aquaculture production with an average growth of   percent per year in the period   reaching a record   million tonnes in  World capture fisheries and aquaculture production by production mode from FAO s Statistical Yearbook  Farming carnivorous fish such as salmon however does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries such farmed fish are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish The  global returns for fish farming recorded by the FAO totaled   million tonnes worth about US  billion Although fish farming for food is the most widespread another major fish farming industry provides living fish for the aquarium trade The vast majority of freshwater fish in the aquarium trade originate from farms in Eastern and Southern Asia eastern Europe Florida and South America that use either indoor tank systems or outdoor pond systems while farming of fish for the marine aquarium trade happens at a much smaller scale Major species See also List of commercially important fish species Top

photosynthetic production extensive or fish that are fed with external food supply intensive Extensive aquaculture Salmon farming in the sea mariculture at Loch Ainort Isle of Skye Scotland Extensive aquaculture is the other form of fish farming Extensive aquaculture is more basic than intensive aquaculture in that less effort is put into the husbandry of the fish Extensive aquaculture is done in the ocean natural and man made lakes bays rivers and Fiords Fish are contained within these habitats by multiple mesh enclosures which also function as trapping nets during harvest Figure   Since fish are susceptible to the elements site placement is essential to ensuring rapid growth of the targeted species The drawback of these facilities is that they depend on the surrounding area for good water quality in order to reduce mortality and increase the survivorship and growth rate of the fish  Fish chosen for extensive aquaculture are very hardy and often do well in high densities Seaweed prawns mussels carp tilapia tuna and salmon are the most prominent forms of extensive aqua cultured seafood Extensive aquaculture facilities have negative impacts on the environment as well Natural habitats are destroyed in the development of man made ponds used for extensive aquaculture In the Philippines shrimp aquaculture is responsible for the destruction of thousands of acres of mangrove fields which serve as nurseries and living habitats for many marine organisms Benthic habitats are being depleted due to the high amount of organic waste produced by the fish which settles below their pens  Phytoplankton and algae breakdown fecal matter and residual fish meal reducing the amount of available oxygen in the water column which chokes and kills the Benthic organisms Another serious problem acquainted with extensive aquaculture is the introduction of invasive species into ecosystems  Escaped fish increase the competition between organisms for limited resources Also when foreign fish interbreed with wild species they upset the genetic variability of the species making them more prone to disease and infection The high density of fish in these mesh tanks is very tempting for predators of the sea and air  To protect the harvest from predators protective netting is set up at a high cost Often times predatorial fish and mammals like seals sharks and tuna get caught in these barrier nets and die Some farmers protect their stocks from predatorial birds such as pelicans and albatross by shooting these sometimes endangered creatures Intensive aquaculture This section needs

be increased at will as long as sufficient oxygen fresh water and food are provided Because of the requirement of sufficient fresh water a massive water purification system must be integrated in the fish farm One way to achieve this is to combine hydroponic horticulture and water treatment see below The exception to this rule are cages which are placed in a river or sea which supplements the fish crop with sufficient oxygenated water Some environmentalists object to this practice Expressing eggs from a female rainbow trout The cost of inputs per unit of fish weight is higher than in extensive farming especially because of the high cost of fish feed It must contain a much higher level of protein up to  than cattle feed and a balanced amino acid composition as well These higher protein level requirements are a consequence of the higher feed efficiency of aquatic animals higher feed conversion ratio that is kg of feed per kg of animal produced Fish such as salmon have an FCR around   kg of feed per kg of salmon whereas chickens are in the   kg of feed per kg of chicken range Fish do not use energy to keep warm eliminating some carbohydrates and fats in the diet required to provide this energy This may be offset though by the lower land costs and the higher production which can be obtained due to the high level of input control Aeration of the water is essential as fish need a sufficient oxygen level for growth This is achieved by bubbling cascade flow or aqueous oxygen Catfish in genus Clarias can breathe atmospheric air and can tolerate much higher levels of pollutants than trout or salmon which makes aeration and water purification less necessary and makes Clarias species especially suited for intensive fish production In some Clarias farms about  of the water volume can consist of fish biomass The risk of infections by parasites such as fish lice fungi Saprolegnia spp intestinal worms such as nematodes or trematodes bacteria e g Yersinia spp Pseudomonas spp and protozoa such as dinoflagellates is similar to that in animal husbandry especially at high population densities However animal husbandry is a larger and more technologically mature area of human agriculture and has developed better solutions to pathogen problems Intensive aquaculture has to provide adequate water quality oxygen ammonia nitrite etc levels to minimize stress on the fish This requirement makes control of the pathogen problem more difficult Intensive aquaculture requires tight monitoring and a high level of expertise of the fish farmer Controlling roes manually Very high intensity recycle aquaculture systems RAS also Recirculating Aquaculture Systems where all the production parameters are controlled are being used for high value species By recycling water little is used per unit of production However the process has high capital and operating costs The higher cost structures mean that RAS is economical only for high value products such as broodstock for egg production fingerlings for net pen aquaculture operations sturgeon production research animals and some special niche markets such as live fish Raising ornamental coldwater fish goldfish or koi although theoretically much more profitable due to the higher income per weight of fish produced has been successfully carried out only in the st century The increased incidences of dangerous viral diseases of koi carp together with the high value of the fish has led to initiatives in closed system koi breeding and growing in a number of countries Today a few commercially successful intensive koi growing facilities are operating in the UK Germany and Israel Some producers have adapted their intensive systems in an effort to provide consumers with fish that do not carry dormant forms of viruses and diseases In  juvenile Nile tilapia were given a food containing dried Schizochytrium in place of fish oil When compared to a control group raised on regular food they exhibited higher weight gain and better food to growth conversion plus their flesh was higher in healthy omega  fatty acids Fish farms Within intensive and extensive aquaculture methods numerous specific types of fish farms are used each has benefits and applications unique to its design Cage system Giant gourami is often raised in cages in central Thailand Fish cages are placed in lakes bayous ponds rivers or oceans to contain and protect fish until they can be harvested The method is also called off shore cultivation when the cages are placed in the sea They can be constructed of a wide variety of components Fish are stocked in cages artificially fed and harvested when they reach market size A few advantages of fish farming with cages are that many types of waters can be used rivers lakes filled quarries etc many types of fish can be raised and fish farming can co exist with sport fishing and other water uses Cage farming of fishes in open seas is also gaining in popularity Given concerns of disease poaching poor water quality etc generally pond systems are considered simpler to start and easier to manage Also the past occurrences of cage failures leading to escapes have raised concern regarding the culture of non native fish species in dam or open water cages On August   there was a massive failure of such cages at a commercial fishery in Washington state in Puget Sound leading to release of nearly   Atlantic salmon in non native waters This is believed to risk endangering the native Pacific salmon species Marine Scotland has kept records of caged fish escapes since  They have recorded  fish escape incidents with    fish escaping into fresh and salt water One company Dawnfresh Farming Limited has been responsible for  incident and   Rainbow Trout escaping into freshwater lochs Though the cage industry has made numerous technological advances in cage construction in recent years the risk of damage and escape due to storms is always a concern Semi submersible marine technology is beginning to impact fish farming In    million salmon are in the middle of a year long trial at Ocean Farm  off the coast of Norway The semi submersible US  million project is the world s first deep sea aquaculture project and includes  meter  ft high by  meter  ft diameter pen made from a series of mesh wire frames and nets It is designed to disperse wastes better than more conventional farms in sheltered coastal waters therefore supporting higher fish packing density Copper alloy nets Main article Copper alloys in aquaculture Recently copper alloys have become important netting materials in aquaculture Copper alloys are antimicrobial that is they destroy bacteria viruses fungi algae and other microbes In the marine environment the antimicrobial algaecidal properties of copper alloys prevent biofouling which can briefly be described as the undesirable accumulation adhesion and growth of microorganisms plants algae tube worms barnacles mollusks and other organisms The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive Traditional netting involves regular and labor intensive cleaning In addition to its antifouling benefits copper netting has strong structural and corrosion resistant properties in marine environments Copper zinc brass alloys are deployed in commercial scale aquaculture operations in Asia South America and USA Hawaii Extensive research including demonstrations and trials are being implemented on two other copper alloys copper nickel and copper silicon Each of these alloy types has an inherent ability to reduce biofouling cage waste disease and the need for antibiotics while simultaneously maintaining water circulation and oxygen requirements Other types of copper alloys are also being considered for research and development in aquaculture operations In Southeast Asia the traditional cage farming platform is called kelong Open net pen system The open net pens system is a method that takes place in natural waters such as rivers lakes near the coast or offshore The breeders rear the fish in large cages floating in the water The fish are living in natural water but are isolated with a net Because the only barrier separating the fish from the surrounding environment is a net this allows the water to flow from the natural surrounding through the fish farms The site of the fish farm is crucial for the farm to be a success or not Before any fish farm is settled it is highly recommended to be selective with the site location of the farm The site must be examined on some essential elements Important conditions on the location are A good interchange of water and also a high replacement of bottom water At all depths should be a good current condition This is necessary because the organic particles should be able to be carried away using the current A gravel and sand bottom are qualified for fish farming although bottoms with silt and mud are not qualified These should be avoided A net should be at least  metres  ft or more above the bottom so depth is important Despite these important site conditions the open net pen method was very popular in Norway and China This is because of the cost friendliness and efficiency of this method Negative external effects Because of the ocean s water flow and other reasons open net pen culture is seen as a high risk method for the environment The flow allows chemicals parasites waste and diseases to spread in the enclosed environment and this is not beneficial for the natural environment Another negative consequence is the high escape rate of the cultured fish from these open net pens These escaped fish also pose a high risk to the surrounding ecosystems The amount of organic waste produced by fish farms is also alarming A salmon farm in Scotland for instance is estimated to produce as much organic waste as equivalent to a town of people between   and   people each year Today  of the world s seafood is farm raised Irrigation ditch or pond systems These fish farming ponds were created as a cooperative project in a rural village in the Congo These use irrigation ditches or farm ponds to raise fish The basic requirement is to have a ditch or pond that retains water possibly with an above ground irrigation system many irrigation systems use buried pipes with headers Using this method water allotments can be stored in ponds or ditches usually lined with bentonite clay In small systems the fish are often fed commercial fish food and their waste products can help fertilize the fields In larger ponds the pond grows water plants and algae as fish food Some of the most successful ponds grow introduced strains of plants as well as introduced strains of fish Control of water quality is crucial Fertilizing clarifying and pH control of the water can increase yields substantially as long as eutrophication is prevented and oxygen levels stay high Yields can be low if the fish grow ill from electrolyte stress Composite fish culture The composite fish culture system is a technology developed in India by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in the s In this system of both local and imported fish a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fish pond These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them by having different types of food habitats As a result the food available in all the parts of the pond is used Fish used in this system include catla and silver carp surface feeders rohu a column feeder and mrigal and common carp bottom feeders Other fish also feed on the excreta of the common carp and this helps contribute to the efficiency of the system which in optimal conditions produces   kg of fish per hectare per year One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon Even if fish are collected from the wild they can be mixed with other species as well Thus a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of good quality stock To overcome this problem ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation This has ensured the supply of pure fish stock in desired quantities Integrated recycling systems Main article Aquaponics Aerators in a fish farm Ararat plain Armenia One of the largest problems with freshwater pisciculture is that it can use a million gallons of water per acre about  m of water per m each year Extended water purification systems allow for the reuse recycling of local water The largest scale pure fish farms use a system derived admittedly much refined from the New Alchemy Institute in the s Basically large plastic fish tanks are placed in a greenhouse A hydroponic bed is placed near above or between them When tilapia are raised in the tanks they are able to eat algae which naturally grow in the tanks when the tanks are properly fertilized The tank water is slowly circulated to the hydroponic beds where the tilapia waste feeds commercial plant crops Carefully cultured microorganisms in the hydroponic bed convert ammonia to nitrates and the plants are fertilized by the nitrates and phosphates Other wastes are strained out by the hydroponic media which double as an aerated pebble bed filter This system properly tuned produces more edible protein per unit area than any other A wide variety of plants can grow well in the hydroponic beds Most growers concentrate on herbs e g parsley and basil which command premium prices in small quantities all year long The most common customers are restaurant wholesalers Since the system lives in a greenhouse it adapts to almost all temperate climates and may also adapt to tropical climates The main environmental impact is discharge of water that must be salted to maintain the fishes electrolyte balance Current growers use a variety of proprietary tricks to keep fish healthy reducing their expenses for salt and wastewater discharge permits Some veterinary authorities speculate that ultraviolet ozone disinfectant systems widely used for ornamental fish may play a prominent part in keeping the tilapia healthy with recirculated water A number of large well capitalized ventures in this area have failed Managing both the biology and markets is complicated One future development is the combination of integrated recycling systems with urban farming as tried in Sweden by the Greenfish Initiative Classic fry farming This is also called a flow through system Trout and other sport fish are often raised from eggs to fry or fingerlings and then trucked to streams and released Normally the fry are raised in long shallow concrete tanks fed with fresh stream water The fry receive commercial fish food in pellets While not as efficient as the New Alchemists method it is also far simpler and has been used for many years to stock streams with sport fish European eel Anguilla anguilla aquaculturalists procure a limited supply of glass eels juvenile stages of the European eel which swim north from the Sargasso Sea breeding grounds for their farms The European eel is threatened with extinction because of the excessive catch of glass eels by Spanish fishermen and overfishing of adult eels in e g the Dutch IJsselmeer Although European eel larvae can survive for several weeks the full life cycle has not yet been achieved in captivity Issues See also Aquaculture of salmon Issues Mean eutrophying emissions water pollution of different

farming has been a controversial one Many cultured fishes tilapia carp catfish many others can be raised on a strictly herbivorous diet Top level carnivores most salmonidae species in particular on the other hand depend on fish feed of which a large portion is usually derived from wild caught fish anchovies menhaden etc Vegetable derived proteins have successfully replaced fish meal in feeds for carnivorous fishes but vegetable derived oils have not successfully been incorporated into the diets of carnivores Research is underway to try to change this such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products The F Challenge Fish Free Feed Challenge as explained by a report from Wired in February  is a race to sell   metric tons of fish food without the fish Earlier this month start ups from places like Pakistan China and Belgium joined their American competition at the Google headquarters in Mountain View California showing off feed made from seaweed extracts yeast and algae grown in bioreactors Not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish like certain salmon species remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies but they are not helping the health of the fish as is the case in Norway Between  and  Aldrin et al examined three infectious diseases in Norwegian salmon fish farms heart and skeletal muscle inflammation pancreas disease and infectious salmon anemia In  Martinez Rubio et al conducted a study in which cardiomyopathy syndrome CMS a severe cardiac disease in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was investigated pertaining the effects of functional feeds with reduced lipid content and increased eicosapentaenoic acid levels in controlling CMS in salmon after infection with Piscine Myocarditis Virus PMCV Functional feeds are defined as high quality feeds that beyond purposes of nutrition they are formulated with health promoting features that could be beneficial in supporting disease resistance such as CMS Choosing a clinical nutrition approach using functional feeds could potentially move away from chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatments which could lower the costs of disease treatment and management in fish farms In this investigation three fishmeal based diets were served one made of  lipid and the other two made of  lipid one contained fishmeal and the other krill meal Results demonstrated a significant difference in the immune and inflammatory responses and pathology in heart tissue as the fish were infected with PMCV Fish fed with functional feeds with low lipid content demonstrated milder and delayed inflammatory response and therefore less severe heart lesions at earlier and later stages after PMCV infection Stocking density Secondly farmed fish are kept in concentrations never seen in the wild e g   fish in a  acre   m area However fish tend also to be animals that aggregate into large schools at high density Most successful aquaculture species are schooling species which do not have social problems at high density Aquaculturists feel that operating a rearing system above its design capacity or above the social density limit of the fish will result in decreased growth rate and increased feed conversion ratio kg dry feed kg of fish produced which results in increased cost and risk of health problems along with a decrease in profits Stressing the animals is not desirable but the concept of and measurement of stress must be viewed from the perspective of the animal using the scientific method Parasites and disease Sea lice particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species including C clemensi and C rogercresseyi can cause deadly infestations of both farm grown and wild salmon Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus blood and skin and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free swimming planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages which can persist for several days Large numbers of highly populated open net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open net farms many young wild salmon are infected and do not survive as a result Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice but small thin skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable On the Pacific coast of Canada the louse induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over  In Scotland official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease parasites botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between  and  One of the treatments for parasite infestations involved bathing fish in hydrogen peroxide which can harm or kill farmed fish if they are in a weak condition or if the chemical concentration is too strong A  meta analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations This relationship has been shown to hold for Atlantic steelhead pink chum and coho salmon The decrease in survival or abundance often exceeds  Diseases and parasites are the most commonly cited reasons for such decreases Some species of sea lice have been noted to target farmed coho and Atlantic salmon Such parasites have been shown to have an effect on nearby wild fish One place that has garnered international media attention is British Columbia s Broughton Archipelago There juvenile wild salmon must run a gauntlet of large fish farms located off shore near river outlets before making their way to sea The farms allegedly cause such severe sea lice infestations that one study predicted in  a  collapse in the wild salmon population by  This claim however has been criticized by numerous scientists who question the correlation between increased fish farming and increases in sea lice infestation among wild salmon Because of parasite problems some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive but many fish still die prematurely at rates up to  Additionally other common drugs used in salmonid fish farms in North America and Europe include anesthetic chemotherapeutic and anthelmintic agents In some cases these drugs have entered the environment Additionally the residual presence of these drugs in human food products has become controversial Use of antibiotics in food production is thought to increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in human diseases At some facilities the use of antibiotic drugs in aquaculture has decreased considerably due to vaccinations and other techniques However most fish farming operations still use antibiotics many of which escape into the surrounding environment The lice and pathogen problems of the s facilitated the development of current treatment methods for sea lice and pathogens which reduced the stress from parasite pathogen problems However being in an ocean environment the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever present risk A North American lake trout fishing farm on Lake Titicaca near Copacabana Bolivia Since their introduction in the s trout have been an invasive species endangering the local fish population Ecosystem impacts The large number of fish kept long term in a single location contributes to habitat destruction of the nearby areas The high concentrations of fish produce a significant amount of condensed faeces often contaminated with drugs which again affects local waterways Aquaculture not only impacts the fish on the farm but it also influences other species which in return are attracted to or repelled by the farms Mobile fauna such as crustaceans fish birds and marine mammals interact with the process of aquaculture but the long term or ecological effects as a result of these interactions is still unknown Some of these fauna may be attracted or demonstrate repulsion The attraction repulsion mechanism has various direct and indirect effects on wild organisms at individual and population levels The interactions that wild organisms have with aquaculture may have implications on the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in relation to how the fish farms are structured and organized Siting If aquaculture farms are placed in an area with strong current pollutants can be flushed out of the area fairly quickly This helps manage the pollution problem and also aids in overall fish growth Concern remains that resultant bacterial growth fertilised by fish faeces strips the water of oxygen reducing or killing off the local marine life Once an area has been so contaminated fish farms are typically moved to new uncontaminated areas This practice has angered nearby fishermen Other potential problems faced by aquaculturists include the obtaining of various permits and water use rights profitability concerns about invasive species and genetic engineering depending on what species are involved and interaction with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Genetic engineering In regards to genetically engineered farmed salmon concern has been raised over their proven reproductive advantage and how it could potentially decimate local fish populations if released into the wild Biologist Rick Howard did a controlled laboratory study where wild fish and genetically engineered fish were allowed to breed In  AquaBounty Technologies developed the AquAdvantage salmon The concerns and critiques of cultivating this genetically engineered fish in aquaculture are that the fish will escape and interact with other fish ultimately leading to the reproduction with other fishes However the FDA has determined that while net pens would not be the most appropriate to prevent escapes raising the salmon in Panama waters would effectively prevent escape because the water conditions there would fail to support long term survival of any escaped salmon Another method of preventing Aqua Advantage fish from impacting the ecosystems in the case they escape suggested by the FDA was to create sterile triploid females This way concerns on reproducing with other fishes would be out of the question The genetically engineered fish crowded out the wild fish in spawning beds but the offspring were less likely to survive The colorant used to make pen raised salmon appear rosy like the wild fish has been linked with retinal problems in humans Labeling In  Alaska passed legislation requiring that any genetically altered fish sold in the state be labeled In  a Consumer Reports investigation revealed that farm raised salmon is frequently sold as wild In  the US National Organic Standards Board allowed farmed fish to be labeled as organic provided less than  of their feed came from wild fish This decision was criticized by the advocacy group Food Water Watch as bending the rules about organic labeling In the European Union fish labeling as to species method of production and origin has been required since  Concerns continue over the labeling of salmon as farmed or wild caught as well as about the humane treatment of farmed fish The Marine Stewardship Council has established an Eco label to distinguish between farmed and wild caught salmon while the RSPCA has established the Freedom Food label to indicate humane treatment of farmed salmon as well as other food products Indoor fish farming Other treatments such as ultraviolet sterilization ozonation and oxygen injection are also used to maintain optimal water quality Through this system many of the environmental drawbacks of aquaculture are minimized including escaped fish water usage and the introduction of pollutants The practices also increased feed use efficiency growth by providing optimum water quality One of the drawbacks to recirculating aquaculture systems is the need for periodic water exchanges However the rate of water exchange can be reduced through aquaponics such as the incorporation of hydroponically grown plants and denitrification Both methods reduce the amount of nitrate in the water and can potentially eliminate the need for water exchanges closing the aquaculture system from the environment The amount of interaction between the aquaculture system and the environment can be measured through the cumulative feed burden CFB kg M which measures the amount of feed that goes into the RAS relative to the amount of water and waste discharged The environmental impact of larger indoor fish farming system will be linked to the local infrastructure and water supply Areas which are more drought prone indoor fish farms might flow out wastewater for watering agricultural farms reducing the water affliction From  a team from the University of Waterloo led by Tahbit Chowdhury and Gordon Graff examined vertical RAS aquaculture designs aimed at producing protein rich fish species However because of its high capital and operating costs RAS has generally been restricted to practices such as broodstock maturation larval rearing fingerling production research animal production specific pathogen free animal production and caviar and ornamental fish production As such research and design work by Chowdhury and Graff remains difficult to implement Although the use of RAS for other species is considered by many aquaculturalists to be currently impractical some limited successful implementation of RAS has occurred with high value product such as barramundi sturgeon and live tilapia in the US eels and catfish in the Netherlands trout in Denmark and salmon is planned in Scotland and Canada Slaughter methods Main article Fish welfare at slaughter Tanks saturated with carbon dioxide have been used to make fish unconscious Their gills are then cut with a knife so that the fish bleed out before they are further processed This is no longer considered a humane method of slaughter Methods that induce much less physiological stress are electrical or percussive stunning and this has led to the phasing out of the carbon dioxide slaughter method in Europe Inhumane methods According to T H stein of the National Veterinary Institute Oslo Norway Different methods for slaughter of fish are in place and it is no doubt that many of them may be considered as appalling from an animal welfare point of view A  report by the EFSA Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare explained Many existing commercial killing methods expose fish to substantial suffering over a prolonged period of time For some species existing methods whilst capable of killing fish humanely are not doing so because operators don t have the knowledge to evaluate them Following are some less humane ways of killing fish Air asphyxiation amounts to suffocation in the open air The process can take upwards of  minutes to induce death although unconsciousness typically sets in sooner Ice baths or chilling of farmed fish on ice or submerged in near freezing water is used to dampen muscle movements by the fish and to delay the onset of post death decay However it does not necessarily reduce sensibility to pain indeed the chilling process has been shown to elevate cortisol In addition reduced body temperature extends the time before fish lose consciousness CO narcosis Exsanguination without stunning is a process in which fish are taken up from water held still and cut so as to cause bleeding According to references in Yue this can leave fish writhing for an average of four minutes and some catfish still responded to noxious stimuli after more than  minutes Immersion in salt followed by gutting or other processing such as smoking is applied to eel More humane methods Proper stunning renders the fish unconscious immediately and for a sufficient period of time such that the fish is killed in the slaughter process e g through exsanguination without regaining consciousness Percussive stunning involves rendering the fish unconscious with a blow on the head Electric stunning can be humane when a proper current is made to flow through the fish brain for a sufficient period of time Electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water dry stunning or while the fish is still in the water The latter generally requires a much higher current and may lead to operator safety issues An advantage could be that in water stunning allows fish to be rendered unconscious without stressful handling or displacement However improper stunning may not induce insensibility long enough to prevent the fish from enduring exsanguination while conscious Whether the optimal stunning parameters that researchers have determined in studies are used by the industry in practice is unknown Gallery Fish farming in the fjords of southern Chile Houseboat rafts with cages under for rearing fish near M Tho Vietnam Transport boats moored at fish processing plant M Tho Communal Zapotec

cartilaginous and bony fish as well as the extinct placoderms and acanthodians Most fish are cold blooded their body temperature varying with the surrounding water though some large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature Many fish can communicate acoustically with each other such as during courtship displays The earliest fish appeared during the Cambrian as small filter feeders they continued to evolve through the Paleozoic diversifying into many forms The earliest fish with dedicated respiratory gills and paired fins the ostracoderms had heavy bony plates that served as protective exoskeletons against invertebrate predators The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian and greatly diversified during the Devonian the Age of Fishes Bony fish distinguished by the presence of swim bladders emerged as the dominant group of fish after the end Devonian extinction wiped out the apex placoderms Bony fish are further divided into the lobe finned and ray finned fish About  of all living fish species today are teleosts a crown group of ray finned fish that can protrude their jaws The tetrapods a mostly terrestrial clade of vertebrates that have dominated the top trophic levels in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems since the Late Paleozoic evolved from lobe finned fish during the Carboniferous developing air breathing lungs homologous to swim bladders Tetrapods are usually not considered to be fish making fish a paraphyletic group Fish have been an important natural resource for people since prehistoric times especially as food Commercial and subsistence fishers harvest fish in wild fisheries or farm them in ponds or in breeding cages in the ocean Fish are caught for for recreation or raised by fishkeepers as ornaments for private and public exhibition in aquaria and garden ponds Fish have had a role in human culture through the ages serving as deities religious symbols and as the subjects of art books and movies Etymology The word fish is inherited from Proto Germanic and is related to German Fisch the Latin piscis and Old Irish asc though the exact root is unknown some authorities reconstruct a Proto Indo European root peysk attested only in Italic Celtic and Germanic Evolution Main article Evolution of fish Fossil history Further information Timeline of fish evolution Dunkleosteus was a giant Devonian armoured Placoderm c  mya About  million years ago during the Cambrian explosion fishlike animals with a notochord and eyes at the front of the body such as Haikouichthys appear in the fossil record During the late Cambrian other jawless forms such as conodonts appear Jawed vertebrates appear in the Silurian with giant armoured placoderms such as Dunkleosteus Jawed fish too appeared during the Silurian the cartilaginous Chondrichthyes and the bony Osteichthyes During the Devonian fish diversity greatly increased including among the placoderms lobe finned fishes and early sharks earning the Devonian the epithet the age of fishes Phylogeny Fishes are a paraphyletic group since any clade containing all fish such as the Gnathostomata or for bony fish Osteichthyes also contains the clade of tetrapods four limbed vertebrates mostly terrestrial which used not to be considered to be fish Some tetrapods such as cetaceans and ichthyosaurs have secondarily acquired a fish like body shape through convergent evolution Fishes of the World comments that it is increasingly widely accepted that tetrapods including ourselves are simply modified bony fishes and so we are comfortable with using the taxon Osteichthyes as a clade which now includes all tetrapods The biodiversity of extant fish is unevenly distributed among the various groups teleosts bony fishes able to protrude their jaws make up  of fish species The cladogram shows the evolutionary relationships of all groups of living fishes with their respective diversity and the tetrapods Extinct groups are marked with a

reason the class Pisces seen in older reference works is no longer used in formal classifications Traditional classification divides fish into three extant classes Agnatha Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes and with extinct forms sometimes classified within those groups sometimes as their own classes Fish account for more than half of vertebrate species As of  there are over   described species of bony fish over   species of cartilaginous fish and over  hagfish and lampreys A third of these fall within the nine largest families from largest to smallest these are Cyprinidae Gobiidae Cichlidae Characidae Loricariidae Balitoridae Serranidae Labridae and Scorpaenidae About  families are monotypic containing only one species Diversity Main article Diversity of fish Fish range in size from the huge  metre  ft whale shark to some tiny teleosts only  millimetre   in such as the cyprinid Paedocypris progenetica and the stout infantfish Largest whale shark Smallest e g P progenetica Swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna salmon and jacks that can cover   body lengths per second to species such as eels and rays that swim no more than   body lengths per second Fastest e g salmon   body lengths second Slowest e g eel   body lengths second A typical fish is cold blooded has a streamlined body for rapid swimming extracts oxygen from water using gills has two sets of paired fins one or two dorsal fins an anal fin and a tail fin jaws skin covered with scales and lays eggs Each criterion has exceptions creating a wide diversity in body shape and way of life For example some fast swimming fish are warm blooded while some slow swimming fish have abandoned streamlining in favour of other body shapes Ambush predator anglerfish Streamlined somewhat warm blooded mackerel Tail not used for swimming seahorse Camouflaged leafy seadragon No scales clingfish Mouthbrooder front cichlid with young in mouth Ecology Habitats Different fish species are adapted to a wide variety of freshwater and marine habitats Fish species are roughly divided equally between marine oceanic and freshwater ecosystems Coral reefs in the Indo Pacific constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests especially the Amazon Congo and Mekong basins More than   fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone such that Neotropical fishes represent about  of all vertebrate species on the Earth Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin such as Cant o State Park can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe Fish are abundant in most bodies of water They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments from high mountain streams e g char and gudgeon to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans e g cusk eels and snailfish although none have been found in the deepest  of the ocean The deepest living fish in the ocean so far found is a cusk eel Abyssobrotula galatheae recorded at the bottom of the Puerto Rico trench at   m   ft In terms of temperature Jonah s icefish live in cold waters of the Southern Ocean including under the Filchner Ronne Ice Shelf at a latitude of  S while desert pupfish live in desert springs streams and marshes sometimes highly saline with water temperatures as high as  C A few fish live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water Mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows A single undescribed species of Phreatobius has been called a true land fish as this worm like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged leaf litter Cavefish of multiple families live in underground lakes underground rivers or aquifers Parasites and predators Further information Fish diseases and parasites and Predatory fish Like other animals fish suffer from parasitism Some species use cleaner fish to remove external parasites The best known of these are the bluestreak cleaner wrasses of coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans These small fish maintain cleaning stations where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus Etroplus maculatus the cleaner and the much larger E suratensis Fish occupy many trophic levels in freshwater and marine food webs Fish at the higher levels are predatory and a substantial part of their prey consists of other fish In addition mammals such as dolphins and seals feed on fish alongside birds such as gannets and cormorants A cleaner fish removing parasites from its client a pufferfish A barracuda preying on a smaller fish Sea lion a predatory mammal eating a large salmonid Cormorant with fish prey Anatomy and physiology Main articles Fish anatomy and Fish physiology Anatomy and locomotion Main article Fish locomotion The body of a typical fish is adapted for efficient swimming by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone These contractions form S shaped curves that move down the body As each curve reaches the tail fin force is applied to the water moving the fish forward The other fins act as control surfaces like an aircraft s flaps enabling the fish to steer in any direction Anatomy of a typical fish lanternfish shown  gill cover  lateral line  dorsal fin  fat fin caudal peduncle  caudal fin  anal fin  photophores  pelvic fins  pectoral fins Since body tissue is denser than water fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that allows them to adjust their buoyancy by increasing or decreasing the amount of gas it contains The scales of fish provide protection from predators at the cost of adding stiffness and weight Fish scales are often highly reflective this silvering provides camouflage in the open ocean Because the water all around is the same colour reflecting an image of the water offers near invisibility Gas filled swim bladder of a rudd helps maintain neutral buoyancy Silvered scales of a rohu provide protection and camouflage Circulation The fish heart pumps blood to the gills where it picks up oxygen The blood then flows without further pumping to the body from where it returns to the heart Fish have a closed loop circulatory system The heart pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body for comparison the mammal heart has two loops one for the lungs to pick up oxygen one for the body to deliver the oxygen In fish the heart pumps blood through the gills Oxygen rich blood then flows without further pumping unlike in mammals to the body tissues Finally oxygen depleted blood returns to the heart Respiration Gills Main article Fish gill Fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx Gills consist of comblike structures called filaments Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills Capillary blood in the gills flows in the opposite direction to the water resulting in efficient countercurrent exchange The gills push the oxygen poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx Cartilaginous fish have multiple gill openings sharks usually have five sometimes six or seven pairs they often have to swim to oxygenate their gills Bony fish have a single gill opening on each side hidden beneath a protective bony cover or operculum They are able to oxygenate their gills using muscles in the head Air breathing Further information amphibious fish Some  species of fish in  families can breathe air enabling them to live in oxygen poor water or to emerge on to land The ability of fish to do this is potentially limited by their single loop circulation as oxygenated blood from their air breathing organ will mix with deoxygenated blood returning to the heart from the rest of the body Lungfish bichirs ropefish bowfins snakefish and the African knifefish have evolved to reduce such mixing and to reduce oxygen loss from the gills to oxygen poor water Bichirs and lungfish have tetrapod like paired lungs requiring them to surface to gulp air and making them obligate air breathers Many other fish including inhabitants of rock pools and the intertidal zone are facultative air breathers able to breathe air when out of water as may occur daily at low tide and to use their gills when in water Some coastal fish like rockskippers and mudskippers choose to leave the water to feed in habitats temporarily exposed to the air Some catfish absorb air through their digestive tracts Digestion The digestive system consists of a tube the gut leading from the mouth to the anus The mouth of most fishes contains teeth to grip prey or crush the food An esophagus carries foot to the stomach where food may be stored and partially digested A sphincter the pylorus releases food to the intestine at intervals Many fish have finger shaped pouches pyloric caeca around the pylorus of doubtful function The pancreas secretes enzymes into the intestine to digest the food other enzymes are secreted directly by the intestine itself The liver produces bile which helps to break up fat into an emulsion which can be absorbed in the intestine Excretion Most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia This may be excreted through the gills or filtered by the kidneys Salt is excreted by the rectal gland Saltwater fish tend to lose water by osmosis their kidneys return water to the body and produce a concentrated urine The reverse happens in freshwater fish they tend to gain water osmotically and produce a dilute urine Some fish have kidneys able to operate in both freshwater and saltwater Brain Diagram of rainbow trout brain from above Fish have small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates typically one fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal However some fish have relatively large brains notably mormyrids and sharks which have brains about as large for their body weight as birds and marsupials At the front of the brain are the olfactory lobes a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves Fish that hunt primarily by smell such as hagfish and sharks have very large olfactory lobes Behind these is the telencephalon which in fish deals mostly with olfaction Together these structures form the forebrain Connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the diencephalon it works with hormones and homeostasis The pineal body is just above the diencephalon it detects light maintains circadian rhythms and controls color changes The midbrain contains the two optic lobes These are very large in species that hunt by sight such as rainbow trout and cichlids The hindbrain controls swimming and balance The single lobed cerebellum is the biggest part of the brain it is small in hagfish and lampreys but very large in mormyrids processing their electrical sense The brain stem or myelencephalon controls some muscles and body organs and governs respiration and osmoregulation Sensory systems Main article Sensory systems in fish The lateral line system is a network of sensors in the skin which detects gentle currents and vibrations and senses the motion of nearby fish whether predators or prey This can be considered both a sense of touch and of hearing Blind cave fish navigate almost entirely through the sensations from their lateral line system Some fish such as catfish and sharks have the ampullae of Lorenzini electroreceptors that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt Vision is an important sensory system in fish Fish eyes are similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals but have a more spherical lens Their retinas generally have both rods and cones for scotopic and photopic vision many species have colour vision often with three types of cone Teleosts can see polarized light some such as cyprinids have a fourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet Amongst jawless fish the lamprey has well developed eyes while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots Hearing too is an important sensory system in fish Fish sense sound using their lateral lines and otoliths in their ears inside their heads Some can detect sound through the swim bladder Some fish including salmon are capable of magnetoreception when the axis of a magnetic field is changed around a circular tank of young fish they reorient themselves in line with the field The mechanism of fish magnetoreception remains unknown experiments in birds imply a quantum radical pair mechanism Cognition Further information Fish intelligence The cognitive capacities of fish include self awareness as seen in mirror tests Manta rays and wrasses placed in front of a mirror repeatedly check whether their reflection s behavior mimics their body movement Choerodon wrasse archerfish and Atlantic cod can solve problems and invent tools The monogamous cichlid Amatitlania siquia exhibits pessimistic behavior when prevented from being with its partner Fish orient themselves using landmarks they may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks Fish are able to learn to traverse mazes showing that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination Electrogenesis The elephantnose fish is a weakly electric fish which generates an electric field with its electric organ and then uses its electroreceptive organs to locate objects by the distortions they cause in its electric field Further information Electroreception and electrogenesis Electric fish such as elephantfishes the African knifefish and electric eels have some of their muscles adapted to generate electric fields They use the field to locate and identify objects such as prey in the waters around them which may be turbid or dark Strongly electric fish like the electric eel can in addition use their electric organs to generate shocks powerful enough to stun their prey Endothermy Most fish are exclusively cold blooded or ectothermic However the Scombroidei are warm blooded endothermic including the billfishes and tunas The opah a lampriform uses whole body endothermy generating heat with its swimming muscles to warm its body while countercurrent exchange minimizes heat loss Among the cartilaginous fishes sharks of the families Lamnidae such as the great white shark and Alopiidae thresher sharks are endothermic The degree of endothermy varies from the billfishes which warm only their eyes and brain to the bluefin tuna and the porbeagle shark which maintain body temperatures more than  C  F above the ambient water Reproduction and life cycle Main article Fish reproduction Salmon fry hatching from the egg keeping its yolk sac The primary reproductive organs are paired testicles and ovaries Eggs are released from the ovary to the oviducts Over  of fish including salmon and goldfish are oviparous meaning that the eggs are shed into the water and develop outside the mother s body The eggs are usually fertilized outside the mother s body with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water In a few oviparous fish such as the skates fertilization is internal the male uses an intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the female s genital opening of the female Marine fish release large numbers of small eggs into the open water column Newly hatched young of oviparous fish are planktonic larvae They have a large yolk sac and do not resemble juvenile or adult fish The larval period in oviparous fish is usually only some weeks and larvae rapidly grow and change in structure to become juveniles During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey Some fish such as surf perches splitfins and lemon sharks are viviparous or live bearing meaning that the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos via a structure analogous to the placenta to connect the mother s blood supply with the embryo s Defenses against disease Further information Immune system Fish have both non specific and immune defenses against disease Non specific defenses include the skin and scales as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms If pathogens breach these defenses the innate immune system can mount an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens non specifically Specific defenses respond to particular antigens such as proteins on the surfaces of pathogenic bacteria recognised by the adaptive immune system Immune systems evolved in deuterostomes as shown in the cladogram Deuterostomes Echinoderms hemichordates cephalochordates urochordates Vertebrates Jawless fishes VLR adaptive immunity Jawed fishes and tetrapods V D J adaptive immunity innate immunity Immune organs vary by type of fish The jawless fish have lymphoid tissue within the anterior kidney and granulocytes in the gut They have their own type of adaptive immune system it makes use of variable lymphocyte receptors VLR to generate immunity to a wide range of antigens The result is much like that of jawed fishes and tetrapods but it may have evolved separately All jawed fishes have an adaptive immune system with B and T lymphocytes bearing immunoglobulins and T cell receptors respectively This makes use of Variable Diversity Joining rearrangement V D J to create immunity to a wide range of antigens This system evolved once and is basal to the jawed vertebrate clade Cartilaginous fish have three specialized organs that contain immune system cells the epigonal organs around the gonads Leydig s organ within the esophagus and a spiral valve in their intestine while their thymus and spleen have similar functions to those of the same organs in the immune systems of tetrapods Teleosts have lymphocytes in the thymus and other immune cells in the spleen and other organs Behavior Shoaling and schooling Main article Shoaling and schooling Fish such as these trumpetfishes school for safety from predators and to spawn A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour such as swimming speed so that it remains close to the other members of the group A school is a much more tightly organised group synchronising its swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation offering improved vigilance against predators It is often more efficient to gather food by working as a group and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal When a predator has been noticed prey fish respond defensively resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn Communication See also Acoustic communication in aquatic animals Fish communicate by transmitting acoustic signals sounds to each other This is most often in the context of feeding aggression or courtship The sounds emitted vary with the species and stimulus involved Fish can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system or can produce non stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder French grunt fish makes sounds by grinding its teeth Some fish produce sounds by rubbing or grinding their bones together These sounds are stridulatory In Haemulon flavolineatum the French grunt fish as it produces a grunting noise by grinding its teeth together especially when in distress The grunts are at a frequency of around  Hz and last approximately  milliseconds The longsnout seahorse Hippocampus reidi produces two categories of sounds clicks and growls by rubbing their coronet bone across the grooved section of their neurocranium Clicks are produced during courtship and feeding and the frequencies of clicks were within the range of  Hz  Hz The frequencies are at the higher end of the range during spawning when the female and male fishes were less than fifteen centimeters apart Growls are produced when the H reidi are stressed The growl sounds consist of a series of sound pulses and are emitted simultaneously with body vibrations Some fish species create noise by engaging specialized muscles that contract and cause swimbladder vibrations Oyster toadfish produce loud grunts by contracting sonic muscles along the sides of the swim bladder Female and male toadfishes emit short duration grunts often as a fright response In addition to short duration grunts male toadfishes produce boat whistle calls These calls are longer in duration lower in frequency and are primarily used to attract mates The various sounds have frequency range of  Hz to  Hz The frequencies of the calls depend on the rate at which the sonic muscles contract The red drum Sciaenops ocellatus produces drumming sounds by vibrating its swimbladder Vibrations are caused by the rapid contraction of sonic muscles that surround the dorsal aspect of the swimbladder These vibrations result in repeated sounds with frequencies from  to  Hz S ocellatus produces different calls depending on the stimuli involved such as courtship or a predator s attack Females do not produce sounds and lack sound producing sonic muscles Conservation The  IUCN Red List names   fish species that are endangered or critically endangered Included are species such as Atlantic cod Devil s Hole pupfish coelacanths and great white sharks Because fish live underwater they are more difficult to study than terrestrial animals and plants and information about fish populations is often lacking However freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies For example the Devil s Hole pupfish occupies only a single  by  metres  by  ft pool Overfishing Main article Overfishing Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery The Food and Agriculture Organization reports that in   percent of the fish stocks of the world s marine fisheries were classified as overfished Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and tuna Overfishing eventually causes fish stocks to collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed Such commercial extinction does not mean that the species is extinct merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery In the case of the Pacific sardine fishery off the California coast the catch steadily declined from a  peak of   tonnes to an economically inviable   tonnes in  In the case of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery overfishing reduced the fish population to  of its historical level by  Fisheries scientists and the fishing industry have sharply differing views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing In many coastal regions the fishing industry is a major employer so governments are predisposed to support it On the other hand scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection warning that many stocks could be destroyed within fifty years Other threats A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution the building of dams removal of water for use by humans and the introduction of exotic species including predators Freshwater fish especially if endemic to a region occurring nowhere else may be threatened with extinction for all these reasons as is the case for three of Spain s ten endemic freshwater fishes River dams especially major schemes like the Kariba Dam Zambezi river and the Aswan Dam River Nile on rivers with economically important fisheries have caused large reductions in fish catch Industrial bottom trawling can damage seabed habitats as has occurred on the Georges Bank in the North Atlantic Introduction of aquatic invasive species is widespread It modifies ecosystems causing biodiversity loss and can harm fisheries Harmful species include fish but are not limited to them the arrival of a comb jelly in the Black Sea damaged the anchovy fishery there The opening of the Suez Canal in  has created Lessepsian migration in which hundreds of species of fish algae and invertebrates have entered the Mediterranean Sea changing its ecology The predatory Nile perch was deliberately introduced to Lake Victoria in the s as a commercial and sports fish The lake had high biodiversity with some  endemic species of cichlid fish It drastically altered the lake s ecology and simplified the fishery from multi species to just three the Nile perch the silver cyprinid and another introduced fish the Nile tilapia The haplochromine cichlid populations have collapsed Importance to humans Economic Main articles Commercial fishing and Fish farming A trawler hauling in a large catch of cod  Throughout history humans have used fish as a food source for dietary protein Historically and today most fish harvested for human consumption has come by means of catching wild fish However fish farming which has been practiced since about   BCE in ancient China is becoming increasingly important in many nations Overall about one sixth of the world s protein is estimated to be provided by fish Fishing is accordingly a large global business which provides income for millions of people The Environmental Defense Fund has a guide on which fish are safe to eat given the state of pollution in today s world and which fish are obtained in a sustainable way As of  over  million tonnes Mt of marine fish and  Mt of freshwater fish were captured while some  Mt of fish mainly freshwater were farmed Of the marine species captured in  anchoveta represented   Mt Alaska pollock   Mt skipjack tuna   Mt and Atlantic herring and yellowfin tuna   Mt each eight more species had catches over  Mt Recreation Further information Fishkeeping and Recreational fishing Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food appearing in cave art being raised as ornamental fish in ponds and displayed in aquariums in homes offices or public settings Recreational fishing is fishing primarily for pleasure or competition it can be contrasted with commercial fishing which is fishing for profit or artisanal fishing which is fishing primarily for food The most common form of recreational fishing employs a rod reel line hooks and a wide range of baits Recreational fishing is particularly popular in North America and Europe government agencies often actively manage target fish species Culture Main article Fish in culture Fish themes have symbolic significance in many religions In ancient Mesopotamia fish offerings were made to the gods from the very earliest times Fish were also a major symbol of Enki the god of water Fish frequently appear as filling motifs in cylinder seals from the Old Babylonian c  BC c  BC and Neo Assyrian   BC periods Starting during the Kassite Period c  BC c  BC and lasting until the early Persian Period   BC healers and exorcists dressed in ritual garb resembling the bodies of fish During the Seleucid Period   BC the legendary Babylonian culture hero Oannes was said to have dressed in the skin of a fish Fish were sacred to the Syrian goddess Atargatis and during her festivals only her priests were permitted to eat them In the Book of Jonah the central figure a prophet named Jonah is swallowed by a giant fish after being thrown overboard by the crew of the ship he is travelling on Early Christians used the ichthys a symbol of a fish to represent Jesus Among the deities said to take the form of a fish are Ikatere of the Polynesians the shark god K mohoali i of Hawai i and Matsya of the Hindus The astrological symbol Pisces is based on a constellation of the same name but there is also a second fish constellation in the night sky Piscis Austrinus Fish feature prominently in art in movies such as Finding Nemo and books such as The Old Man and the Sea Large fish particularly sharks have frequently been the subject of horror movies and thrillers notably the novel Jaws in turn parodied in Shark Tale and Snakehead Terror Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as Piranha Avatar of

Dybowski  Adult grass carpJuvenile grass carp The grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella is a species of large herbivorous freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae native to the Pacific Far East with a native range stretching from northern Vietnam to the Amur River on the Sino Russian border This Asian carp is the only species of the genus Ctenopharyngodon Grass carp are resident fish of large turbid rivers and associated floodplain lakes wetlands with a wide range of temperature tolerance and spawn at temperatures of  to  C  to  F It has been cultivated as a food fish in China for centuries being known as one of the Four Domestic Fish but was later introduced to Europe and the United States for aquatic weed control becoming the fish species with the largest reported farmed production globally over five million tonnes per year Appearance and anatomy Grass carp have elongated chubby torpedo shaped body forms The terminal mouth is slightly oblique with non fleshy firm lips and no barbels The complete lateral line contains  to  scales Broad ridged pharyngeal teeth are arranged in a     formula The dorsal fin has eight to  soft rays and the anal fin is set closer to the tail than most cyprinids Body color is dark olive shading to brownish yellow on the sides with a white belly and large slightly outlined scales Grass carp grow very rapidly Young fish stocked in the spring at  cm   in will reach over  cm  in by fall The typical length is about   cm     in The maximum length is   m   ft and they grow to  kg  lb Ecology Grass carp inhabit lakes ponds pools and backwaters of large rivers preferring large slow flowing or standing water bodies with abundant vegetation In the wild grass carp spawn in fast moving rivers and their eggs which are slightly heavier than water develop while drifting downstream kept in suspension by turbulence Grass carp require long rivers for the survival of the eggs and very young fish and the eggs are thought to die if they sink to the bottom Adult grass carps feed primarily on aquatic plants both higher aquatic plants and submerged terrestrial vegetation but may also eat detritus insects and other invertebrates They eat up to three times their own body weight daily and thrive in small lakes and backwaters that provide an abundant supply of vegetation According to one study grass carp live   years with the oldest surviving  years In Silver Lake Washington a thriving population of grass carp is passing the  year mark Introduced species Grass carp have been introduced to many countries around the world In the Northern Hemisphere countries and territories of introduction include Japan the Philippines Malaysia India Pakistan Iran Israel the United States Mexico Sweden Denmark the United Kingdom France Germany the Netherlands Switzerland Italy Poland the Czech Republic Slovakia Romania Croatia Slovenia Serbia Montenegro Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia In the Southern Hemisphere they have been introduced to Argentina Venezuela Australia New Zealand Fiji and South Africa Grass carp are known to have spawned and established self reproducing populations in only six of the many larger Northern Hemisphere rivers into which they have been stocked Their failure to establish populations in other rivers suggests they have quite specific reproductive requirements In the United States the species was first imported in  from Taiwan and Malaysia to aquaculture facilities in Alabama and Arkansas The first release is believed to have been an accidental escape in  from the U S Fish and Wildlife Service s Fish Farming Experimental Station in Stuttgart Arkansas followed by planned introductions beginning in  Subsequently authorized illegal and accidental introductions have been widespread by the s the species had been introduced to  states and it has since been reported in  of the country s  states In  it was determined to be reproducing in the Great Lakes Basin It is still stocked in many states as an effective biocontrol for undesirable aquatic vegetation many species of which are themselves introduced Use Weed control Grass carp were introduced into New Zealand in  to control the growth of aquatic plants Unlike the other introduced fish brought to New Zealand the potential value and impact of grass carp was investigated in secure facilities prior to their use in field trials They are now approved by the New Zealand government for aquatic weed control although each instance requires specific authorization In the Netherlands the species was also introduced in  to control over abundant aquatic weeds The release was controlled and regulated by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture Nature and Food Quality In both of these countries control is made easier because grass carp are very unlikely to naturally reproduce because of their very specific breeding requirements but elsewhere control is obtained by the use of sterile triploid fish Food Grass carp is one of the most common freshwater farmed fish in China being one of the Four Domestic Fish alongside the Black carp Silver carp and Bighead carp Its meat is tender while with little bone Many Chinese cuisine has grass carp as a featured dish such as Cantonese cuisine In some Asian countries it is believed that ingestion of raw bile or entire gall bladders of the grass carp may improve visual acuity and health However it may in fact cause severe poisoning Fishing for grass carp A grass carp caught on monofilament fishing line Grass carp grow large and are strong fighters when hooked on a line but

mackerels and bonitos Description Japanese amberjack usually grows to around  meter in length though some can reach   meters They have a characteristic yellow band that runs horizontally along the length of the body as well as a yellow tail hence their name Juvenile Japanese amberjack Japanese amberjack painting by Kawahara Keiga   As food The fish is highly appreciated in Japan where it is called hamachi or buri They are eaten either cooked or raw and are a seasonal favourite in the colder months when the meat has a higher fat content Amberjack is typically thought of as a winter delicacy of Toyama and the Hokuriku region Some of the fish consumed are caught wild but a substantial amount is farmed about   tonnes per year To populate the pens every May workers fish for the small wild fry called mojako which can be found under floating seaweed They scoop out the seaweed together with the mojako and put the mojako in cages in the sea The small fry grow until they reach  to  grams in mass the fry are called inada in eastern Japan Kant They are then sold to aquaculturists who grow them until they reach  kilograms youth called hamachi or  kilograms adult called buri

Centropyge interruptus Tanaka  The Japanese angelfish Centropyge interrupta or Japanese pygmy angelfish is a species of marine ray finned fish a marine angelfish belonging to the family Pomacanthidae It is found in the western Pacific Ocean Description The Japanese angelfish has an orange body marked with purple and blue spots It has an orangey yellow body with purplish blue spots completed with a bright yellow tail The spots are larger towards the tail and the bottom part the rear of the fish gradually becomes purple The spots also turn from blue to purple towards the tail Juveniles has a blue margined black ocellus on the posterior part of the dorsal fin The dorsal fin contains  spines and  soft rays while the anal fin has  spines and  soft rays This species attains a maximum total length of  centimetres   in Distribution The Japanese angelfish is found in the western Pacific Ocean They occur in southern Japan from Tokyo to Shikoku as well as around the Izu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands south of Japan They also occur in United States waters around Midway Atoll and Kure Atoll and reaching south to Pearl and Hermes Atoll Habitat and biology The Japanese angelfish is found at depths between  and  metres  and  ft They are typically encountered as pairs on rocky reefs where there are rich growths of coral and algae Their diet consists of algae benthic invertebrates and sponges They are oviparous and monogamous Females change sex to males at a total length of   centimetres   in and this takes   days to complete Systematics The Japanese angelfish was first formally

japonica Binomial name Squatina japonicaBleeker  Range of the Japanese angelshark The Japanese angelshark Squatina japonica is a species of angelshark family Squatinidae found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean off China Japan and Korea It is a bottom dwelling shark found in sandy habitats down to  m  ft deep This species has the flattened shape with wing like pectoral and pelvic fins typical of its family and grows to   m   ft or more in length Its two dorsal fins are placed behind the pelvic fins and a row of large thorns occurs along its dorsal midline Its upper surface is cryptically patterned with numerous squarish dark spots on a brown background Feeding on fishes cephalopods and crustaceans the Japanese angelshark is a nocturnal ambush predator that spends most of the day lying still on the sea floor This species gives birth to live young which are sustained during gestation by yolk The litter size varies from two to  The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen a type of leather Taxonomy and phylogeny The Japanese angelshark was described by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in an  volume of the scientific journal Acta Societatis Scientiarum Indo Neerlandicae The type specimen is a male  cm  in long collected off Nagasaki Japan hence the specific epithet japonica Other common names for this species include change angel shark change canopy shark Japanese angelfish and Japanese monkfish Using mitochondrial DNA a  phylogenetic analysis reported that the Japanese angelshark forms a clade with the other Asian angelsharks included in the study the ocellated angelshark S tergocellatoides and the sister species pair of the Taiwan angelshark S formosa and the Indonesian angelshark S legnota These Asian species are in turn allied with European and North African angel shark species Molecular clock estimation suggested the Japanese angelshark lineage diverged from the rest of the Asian angelsharks some  million years ago during the Cretaceous Description The dorsal fins of the Japanese angelshark are located behind the rear tips of the pelvic fins The Japanese angelshark is fairly narrow bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins The skin folds along the sides of the head lack distinct lobes The eyes are oval and widely spaced closely behind are crescent shaped spiracles with large boxy projections inside their anterior rims Each nostril is large and preceded by a small flap of skin bearing two barbels the outer barbel is thin while the inner barbel has a spoon like tip and a smooth to slightly fringed flange at the base The wide mouth is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners There are  tooth rows on either side of both jaws separated by a gap in the middle the teeth are small narrow and pointed There are five pairs of gill slits located on the sides of the head The frontmost portion of each pectoral fin forms a triangular lobe separate from the head The outer corners of the pectoral fins are angular and their rear tips are rounded The pelvic fins have convex margins The two angular dorsal fins are similar in shape and size and are located behind the pelvic fins The caudal peduncle is flattened with a keel running along either side and supports a roughly triangular caudal fin with rounded corners The lower lobe of the caudal fin is larger than the upper The dorsal surface is covered by medium sized dermal denticles and a distinctive row of large thorns is present along the midline of the back and tail This species is light to dark brown above with a dense covering of squarish dark spots which become finer on the fins The underside is white with darker mottling Various sources give differing maximum lengths ranging from   to   m   to   ft Distribution and habitat The Japanese angelshark is native to the cooler waters of the northwestern Pacific its range extends from the eastern coast of Honshu Japan to Taiwan and includes the southern Sea of Japan the Yellow Sea the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait Some older sources reported it may occur in the Philippines but recent research suggests the only angel shark species in that area is S caillieti The Japanese angelshark inhabits the continental shelf usually in the shallows but also to as deep as  m  ft It is a bottom dweller found over sandy bottoms often close to rocky reefs Biology and ecology The Japanese angelshark generally lies motionless and buried in daytime During the day the Japanese angelshark mostly lies partly buried on the bottom its complex color pattern provides camouflage as it ambushes nearby prey At night this species becomes more active Its diet consists of demersal fishes cephalopods and crustaceans It may be found alone or in proximity to others of its species Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Phyliobothrium marginatum and Tylocephalum squatinae the copepods Eudactylina squatini and Trebius shiinoi and the praniza larvae of the isopod Gnathia trimaculata The Japanese angelshark is viviparous and as in other members of its family the developing embryos are nourished by yolk Litters of two to ten pups are birthed in spring and summer with the newborns measuring  cm   in long Females mature sexually at  cm  in long while male maturation size is unknown Human interactions The Japanese angelshark is typically inoffensive towards humans but if disturbed can inflict a severe bite Across much of its range it is a frequent catch intentional or not in bottom trawls and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets the meat is eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use in wood finishing Angel sharks in general are highly threatened by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction and angel shark species elsewhere are known to have declined markedly under fishing pressure Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea and other parts of the northwestern Pacific is intense and coupled with pollution has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to  or more under these conditions leading the species to be assessed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government though enforcement is inconsistent References a b c d e f g Walls R H L Rigby C L Derrick D Dyldin Y V Ebert D A Herman K

manabei Jordan  Anguilla nigricans Chu Wu  Anguilla remifera Jordan Evermann  Anguilla sinensis McClelland  Muraena pekinensis Basilewsky  The Japanese eel Anguilla japonica nihon unagi is a species of anguillid eel found in Japan Korea Taiwan China and Vietnam as well as the northern Philippines Like all the eels of the genus Anguilla and the family Anguillidae it is catadromous meaning it spawns in the sea but lives parts of its life in freshwater Raised in aquaculture ponds in most countries the Japanese eel makes up  of the commercially sold eel in Japan the other  is shipped over by air to the country from Europe This food in Japan is called unagi they are an essential part of the food culture with many restaurants serving grilled eel called kabayaki However presumably due to a combination of overfishing and habitat loss or changing water conditions in the ocean interfering with spawning and the transport of their leptocephali this species is endangered Breeding Between April and November the Japanese eels leave their freshwater river habitats in East Asia to breed larvae in the ocean near the North Equatorial Current in the western North Pacific Adult Japanese eels migrate thousands of kilometers from freshwater rivers in East Asia to their spawning area without feeding The eels are able to travel this long distance without nutrients because of the oils they collect in their bodies before the migration out to sea The spawning area for this species is approximately  N  E a location corresponding with the location of a salinity front separating the north equatorial current from the tropical waters This front is an indicator to tell the eels that they are in their preferred spawning location The North Equatorial Current assists the eels in migrating from the center of the Pacific Ocean to the coast of Asia without this indicator the larvae would end up in the Mindanao Current North Equatorial Current The discovery of the Japanese eel breeding location was a new finding in  when R V Hakuho Maru performed a research cruise Before this research cruise little was known about how eels breed and there is still so much to learn as these eels remain a mystery to many scientists Until the late th century scientists hypothesized that the different stages of the eel s life cycle were entirely different species Then in  the same team of Japanese scientists at the University of Tokyo found a more precise location of spawning based on genetically identified specimens of newly hatched pre larva only  to  days old in a small area near the Suruga Seamount to the west of the Mariana Islands   N   E The larvae also known as leptocephalius hatch from the egg approximately  hours after fertilization These leptocephalius grow from   to   mm growing by   mm daily After riding the north equatorial current the leptocephali take and head northward by the Kuroshio Current to east Asia These eels live in rivers lakes and estuaries until they return to the ocean as adults to breed and die off Life cycle The Japanese eel metamorphoses into five stages throughout its life cycle all with their distinct names In the open ocean leptocephalus the first stage after the egg feed on marine snow Approximately  months after hatching they metamorphose into glass eels a name derived from their clear appearance Eel life cycle As these glass eels reach their freshwater habitats from December to April they become known as Elvers The migration time of this species corresponds with the moon as it affects the tide This time is during a tide that occurs at night and simulates a flood making it easier for the eels to survive their migration An eel at this stage in its life cycle is  cm long with an intense instinct to swim upstream This instinct allows them to scale any scenario and attempt to make it to their permanent habitat During this migration the eels are not presented with many predators as they are not commonly preyed on during the eel s life cycle stage This low number of predators could also affect the nocturnal nature of the eels during this time They chose to swim upstream during the night hours and hide under banks and rockets of the river during the day Two weeks into this migration the eels develop a black coloring and metamorphosis from elvers to brown stage eels to continue their journey The brown stage also known as the yellow stage stage of the eel s life lasts for   years and during this time the eel feeds on worms and insects The characteristics of this stage include a dull pigment with a grey brown and greenish top and white underbelly This pigment is related to the environment as it relies significantly on the color of the water The eels grow to around their adult size in this stage as well during this time which is up to   cm for females and  cm for males At  cm the eels grow sexual organs for the first time and prepare to make their great migration Once these eels reach adulthood they develop a silvery color under their skin This change in appearance signaling that they are entering their last stage of life the silver stage During this time the eels prepare to migrate to the spawning area by naturally producing more oil in their body This oil is stored in the muscles of the eels and is approximately  of their body mass Once the appropriate content of the oil is reached the eels stop feeding During the autumn and generally on the last quarter of the moon the eels migrate downstream to the center of the pacific Life history and habitat Japanese eel The Japanese eel and other anguillid eels live in freshwater and estuaries an area where a freshwater river meets the ocean Since then more pre leptocephali were collected at sea and even Japanese eel eggs have been collected and genetically identified on the research vessel The collections of eggs and recently hatched larvae have been made along the western side of the seamount chain of the West Mariana Ridge Mature adults of the Japanese eel and giant mottled eel were captured using large midwater trawls in  by Japanese scientists at the Fisheries Research Agency The adults of the Japanese eel appear to spawn in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean based on the recent catches of their spawning adults eggs and newly hatched larvae The timing of catches of eggs and larvae and the ages of larger larvae have shown that Japanese eels only spawn during the few days just before the new moon period of each month during their spawning season After hatching in the ocean the leptocephali are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia before they metamorphose into the glass eel stage The glass eels then enter the estuaries and headwaters of rivers and many travel upstream In fresh water and estuaries the diet of yellow eels consists mainly of shrimp other crustaceans aquatic insects and small fishes Conservation Threats In the case of the Japanese eel s spawning is likely affected by the north south shifts of a salinity front created by an area of low salinity waters resulting from tropical rainfall The front is thought to be detected by the adult spawning eels and to affect the latitudes at which they spawn A northward shift in the front that occurred over the past  years appears to have occurred which could cause more larvae to be retained in eddies offshore in the region east of Taiwan and southward shifts in the salinity front have been observed in recent years that could increase southward transport into the Mindanao Current that flows into the Celebes Sea These types of unfavorable larval transport are thought to reduce the recruitment success of the Japanese eels that reach river mouths as glass eels example of growth of human population by waterThe decline of the population of the Japanese eel is also directly related to the strong connection that the eel s life cycle has with the temperature of the water This species relies on this environmental signal to know when to migrate in and out of their fresh water habitat thus the change in water temperature is directly proportional to the decline in population size These rising water temperatures to ocean acidification and the thinning of the ozone layer These eels are having a more challenging time knowing when to migrate When migrating into their freshwater habitats they prefer  to  degrees Celsius a temperature usually reached in the autumn months but is getting later and later Another factor that is effecting the Japanese eels is habitats loss The coast is becoming a more preferred location for humans to live as the climate and pollution continues to worsen taking away from the habitat of these eels On average from s s   of the Japanese eels habitat is lost to human development Status The Japanese Eel is considered an endangered species by IUCN The last time that this species was assessed in November  and according to that assessment the population size is still decreasing Efforts There are multiple preservation effectors that the Japanese government is undertaking to slow or stop the extinction of this highly important species for their consumption In  the Inland Water Fishery Promotion Act was put in place preventing the fishing and culturing of eels without the proper permit The goal of this act was to slow down the over fishing of the Japanese eel and control the number of eels being taken into captivity In the future there is a law being placed that in December  that makes fishing glass eels without a permit punishable with up to  years in prison or a  million Japanese yen fine There have also been efforts made to stop the habitat loss of this species through the Nature oriented river works The high price and demand of this species means that there is also need for the Act on Ensuring the Proper Domestic Distribution and Importation of Specified Aquatic Animals and Plants that prohibits harvesting and culturing these eels without a permit that was put in place in  Aquaculture Green water culture system for Japanese eel Total production of Japanese eel in thousands of tonnes as reported by the FAO  The culturing of eels was started in Japan in  and has become the most significant eel culture industry in the world since Japan is the biggest consumer and producer of eels generating approximately   of the eel population as of  The farming of the Japanese eel is challenging due to the breeding habits Scientists and farmers have never been able to breed an eel so this species agriculture relies heavily on their catch in their elver stage A net is strewn across the rivers that these eels migrate up in the early autumn and then they are transported to cultured ponds to grow to commercial size The female eel grows to a much bigger size and has a longer life span than the male eel therefor the cultured population is made up of  female eel The heavy farming of this species has negatively impacted the conservation of the species however the production and consumption have not slowed Scientific and medical use Bilirubin inducible green fluorescent protein UnaGIdentifiersOrganismAnguilla japonicaSymbolUnaGUniProtPDMSearch forStructuresSwiss modelDomainsInterPro The Japanese eel has the ability to produce the protein UnaG which makes it unique among vertebrates This protein is only found in the muscles of this species of eels making it a rare commodity UnaG has demonstrated utility in life sciences and can be used to fluorescently label cells and tag proteins when exogenously expressed This protein has been used in an experimental diagnostic test to assess liver function Consumption Main article Unagi As a food product the Japanese eel is commonly referred to as unagi or kabayaki with the latter being the method which the eels are often prepared Kabayaki eels are prepared by being cut into fillets deboned skewered marinated in sweet soy sauce usually tare sauce and then grilled Japanese eels that have been grilled without tare sauce and seasoned only with salt are referred as Shirayaki Eels are eaten all year round in Japan Dishes made with Japanese eel include unaj a dish consisting of the better cuts of eel served in a lacquered box over steamed rice and unadon a donburi type dish where fillets of eels are served over rice in a large bowl Japanese eel is also served as sushi commonly called unagi sushi Some notable types include unakyu a type of sushi containing eel and cucumber and rock and roll a western style sushi made with eel and avocado The Japanese eel contains a protein toxin in its blood that can cause harm to any mammals that ingest it including humans However there is no need for any special procedures as temperatures of   C   F destroy the toxin Thus Japanese eels are always cooked before consuption even unagi sushi Eels intended to be used in sushi are usually sold in pre cooked fillets by many sushi suppliers Due to the decline of the population of the Japanese eels they are often being substituted with European or American eels even within Japan where Japanese eels were commonly used Japanese eels are a good source of a wide range of vitamins and minerals A serving of  grams contains roughly  of vitamin B  of vitamin D and  of the recommended daily value of vitamin A They are also a source of vitamins such as B B E D and niacin Minerals such as phosphorus selenium zinc and potassium are also present along with traces of magnesium copper and iron Additionally they are rich in dietary protein and contain a good amount of omega  fatty acids albeit not as much as other seafood like sardines They contain relatively low quantities of mercury

Trachurops japonicus Temminck Schlegel  Trachurus argenteus Wakiya  The Japanese jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus also known as the Japanese horse mackerel or Japanese scad is a species named after its resemblance to mackerel but which is in the family Carangidae the jacks pompanos trevallies and scads Their maximum reported length is  cm  in with a common length of  cm  in They have a maximum reported weight of   kg   lb and a maximum reported age of  years They are found around the coast of Japan except Okinawa Island usually on sandy bottoms of   m   ft deep They feed mainly on small crustaceans such as copepods as well as shrimp and small fish They are similar to the yellowtail horse mackerel around New Zealand and Australia apart from having more gill rakers and larger eyes The Japanese name for the horse mackerel is aji and by default generally implies the species Trachurus japonicus which can be more specifically referred to as ma aji literally true aji The name is most commonly written in hiragana although a kanji does exist it is not in common use It is commonly deep fried or salt grilled In Korean cuisine the fish is dubbed jeon gaeng i and is the default horse mackerel designated by this name It is commonly grilled or fried as a jeon gaeng i gui Among the specialties of Jeju cuisine is the soup gagjaegi gug the name of which is derived from the name for the fish in the Jeju language Description The Japanese jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus is a small fish with an average length between   cm and a maximum recorded size of  cm It is greyish blue on its back having a silver color on its underside with a black blotch over the gills The dorsal and pectoral fins are a dusky color whereas the pelvic and anal fins are pale One of the main distinguishing features of the Japanese Jack Mackerel is its bright yellow caudal fin which stands out compared to the rest of the species coloration Its scales are common among other species in its family being dense in a horizontal and coarse in a vertical direction with a bend in the midpoint of the scale to follow the curvature of the animal Scales on anterior half of the species have this curve while those on the posterior half are straight with any scales in between these two sections being pointed The spine of the species consists of  vertebrae connected to the dorsal fin with another  vertebrae on the underside of the animal all with fine ridges lining them common with other species in the family Trachurus The dorsal fin is split into two sections the front set consisting of eight bony spines and the rear set having one bony spine and another   soft rays depending on the size of the individual All these fins are controlled by  muscles and many ligaments The caudal fin on the side of jack mackerel is a much more complex structure of about  cm with a series of  bones more than  soft rays projecting outwards and  muscles controlling its movement The anal fin is made up of a collection of  spines with   soft rays coming from them The jaw of the Japanese Jack Mackerel has a projected lower section and is lined with  separate segments of small conical teeth with medially bent tips which become larger moving towards the back of the jaw Distribution and habitat Japanese jack mackerel aji in commercial packaging for purchase The Japanese jack mackerel generally lives in and around the East China Sea and Sea of Japan in tropical regions between the coordinates of  N  N and  E  E Although these are the main population grounds of the Japanese Jack Mackerel they are also found in southern Japan the Korean peninsula and in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southeast Asia primarily in Taiwan These locations vary depending on the temperature of the water primarily and thus vary with the seasons with a higher density of Japanese Jack Mackerel in the southern and central china seas in the colder months The ideal condition for the species ranges between   C with an ideal temperature of around  C With the temperature varying between the northern and southern areas of the East China Sea by around   C migration between these regions is a highly beneficial strategy for the species especially during maturation There are many spawning grounds for the Japanese Jack Mackerel all of which make use of the Kuroshio and Warm Tsushima Currents to migrate into the Japan or East China seas The primary spawning grounds are along the warm coastal waters of Japan with a large portion being around the region of Kyushu and southern Japan The only other intensive spawning ground is the coastal waters of Taiwan which also uses the Kuroshio current to move into the Eastern China and Japan seas The transport of the juveniles from this spawning ground can take up to  days whereas those spawned in and around the Japan coastal waters can take up to  months to reach the Eastern China Sea The southern and central areas of the Eastern China Sea are the main areas in which juvenile Japanese Jack Mackerel are found due to the warmer waters This higher temperature allows for a higher survival rate for the growing fish with    of all Japanese Jack Mackerel found in the southern Eastern China Sea being juveniles Due to the juveniles requiring a temperature above  C to be able to develop and survive vertical distribution is also very important and varies across the ages of the species Juveniles under the age of  year old are not found anywhere below  m deep and thrive in the   m depth range due to the higher temperatures Once mature Japanese Jack Mackerels can be found at depths reaching up to  m Biology and ecology Life cycle The life cycle of the Japanese jack mackerel starts in the late winter and tend to spawn around late April to early July as water temperatures begin to rise allowing larvae and juveniles to thrive as an egg    mm in diameter with a light brown oil globule    mm in diameter which constitutes the yolk of the egg The location for spawning is dictated by several factors including phytoplankton productivity and migrating ability but primarily temperature The eggs are Pelagic therefore float freely through the open sea and continue to do so as larvae Once hatched the larvae are    mm in length and continue to carry the yolk sack beyond the anterior margin of the head This continues until the th day after hatching where the yolk sack is completely absorbed Development continues for  days before reaching the juvenile stage where the dorsal pelvic and anal rays and fins are developed and the body is elongated to around   cm Throughout the juvenile stages scutes and scales fully develop as well as rays on the pectoral and caudal fins until reaching full maturity at around  days after hatching and reaching an average length of around  cm Feeding As a juvenile the Japanese jack mackerel mainly feeds on zooplankton drift algae and flotsam throughout its developmental phases Throughout maturity it feeds on a much wider variety of species although it mostly feeds on copepods which are small crustaceans normally   mm in size Additionally the Japanese Jack Mackerel feeds on small shrimp or other small fish The species normally hunts in large schools but in the case of individuals residing in reefs they have been documented accompanying jellyfish for both feeding and protective purposes The jellyfish are not a part of the Jack Mackerel s diet but they rather use the jellyfish as a method for food collection and a way to hide from predators when not a part of a larger school Threats As larvae and juveniles the main threat posed to Japanese jack mackerel are the larger fish which feed on the vulnerable developing fish as it lacks the mobility of a mature individual As a mature adult the Jack Mackerel is hunted by other pelagic species such as tuna sea lions sharks and dolphins Additionally sea birds pose a great threat to both mature and juvenile Japanese Jack mackerel as juveniles stay closer to the surface and adults venture to shallow waters to occasionally feed Human interactions Food Japanese jack mackerel sashimi The Japanese jack mackerel is a fish predominantly caught using trawls purse seines traps and on line gear Due to the overfishing and exploitation of wild populations of Japanese Jack Mackerel and their major role in ocean ecosystems annual catching limits have been applied since  This limitation has seen a drastic decrease in Jack Mackerel yields from up to   tons year down to between     tons year Most of the fish used commercially and for food globally is caught in the wild with only a small percentage being bred through aquaculture productions Aquaculture of the Japanese Jack Mackerel similarly capture production has dropped drastically over the year with now less than  tons year being produced compared to the  tons produced in the early s In Japan horse mackerel is often deep fried with panko Japanese jack mackerel are used in a few ways once caught and are generally canned for use in various dishes or turned into fish meal Some traditional Japanese dishes use jack mackerel as a key ingredient and it is commonly deep fried aji furai salt grilled shioyaki aji or used raw in sushi or as sashimi In Korean cuisine the jack mackerel is similarly used deep fried or grilled and occasionally used in soups Capture of Japanese horse mackerel in tonnes from  to  Conservation In the s peak yields of Japanese jack mackerel were caught of around   tons year but before the s this number decreased to around   tons year which was an indicator of overfishing In the early s less than   tons year were caught and the aquaculture production of jack mackerel began to try and compensate for this loss of yield This decrease in capture production led to a catching limit being applied in  which stabilized the capture rate to around     tons year Special conservation efforts have been put in place in key spawning grounds of the jack mackerel including the Uwa Sea and Bungo Channel among the southern islands of Japan This was put in place in  and was a direct response to lowered catch yields and higher volumes of juveniles being captured between  and  Culture Although not a strong cultural icon the Japanese jack mackerel is used in a large portion of both Japanese and Korean dishes and are an important global export for Japanese fisheries Additionally due to the spawning grounds being tied to the Japanese coastal waters efforts have been made by Japanese fisheries to prevent their exploitation Phylogeny The Japanese jack mackerel belongs to the family Carangidae which is a family of ray finned fish such as jacks pompanos runners and scads All species in this family have  or more dorsal fins with   rays coming from each of the caudal anal and dorsal fins The Genus Trachurus is a group of Jack Mackerels and Saurels which are derived from the Greek word trachys meaning rough and oura meaning tail The Japanese Jack Mackerel has been found to be more genetically similar to those under the family Scombridae a family of mackerels tuna swordfish and dolphinfish Despite this Trachurus Japonicus remains in the family Carangidae due to strong morphological differences between the families References Carpenter K E Jiddawi N Borsa P Smith Vaniz W F Yahya S Obota C  Trachurus japonicus IUCN Red List of Threatened

Squaliformes Family Oxynotidae Genus Oxynotus Species O japonicus Binomial name Oxynotus japonicusKa Yano Murofushi  Range of the Japanese roughshark Sharks portal The Japanese roughshark Oxynotus japonicus is a rare species of shark in the family Oxynotidae known only from a handful of specimens recovered from Suruga Bay and the Enshunada Sea off Japan It is a benthic species that occurs at a depth of   m    ft This shark is caught and discarded as bycatch by bottom trawlers throughout its entire limited range and may be threatened given the declines in other bottom deep sea species in Suruga Bay This species grows to   cm   in long It is similar to other rough sharks in having a stout high trunk a dorsally depressed head and two sail like dorsal fins with deeply embedded spines The snout is short with large nostrils whose lateral and medial apertures are separated by a thick nasal flap The eyes and spiracles are oval in shape The five pairs of gill slits are very small and vertical The mouth is small with thick fleshy lips the teeth in the upper jaw are narrow erect and smooth edged while those in the lower jaw are broad blade like and smooth edged Only one row of teeth in the lower jaw are functional The large dorsal fins are subtriangular in shape with the first dorsal spine sloping slightly backward The pectoral fins have a convex front margin and a concave rear margin The anal fin is absent There is a strong ridge running between the pectoral and pelvic fins on each side of the body The dermal denticles are large and widely spaced giving the skin a very rough texture This species differs from the similar sailfin roughshark in the positioning of the dorsal fins and the shape of the spiracle The color is a uniform dark brown with the lips nasal flap margins fin axils and inner margins of claspers white Reproduction is ovoviviparous as in other dogfish sharks Size at maturity is  cm  in long for females and  cm  in long for males References a b c

Pristiophorus japonicusG nther  Range of the Japanese sawshark Sharks portal A Japanese sawshark laying on the sea bottom The Japanese sawshark Pristiophorus japonicus is a species of sawshark in the family Pristiophoridae This shark has a long narrow rostrum Its first dorsal fin originates behind the tips of the pectoral fins and its caudal fin is angled almost straight in line with the body The Japanese sawshark reaches a maximum length of up to   m  ft  in Range and habitat Found in the northwest Pacific Ocean around Japan Korea Taiwan and northern China between latitudes  N and  N It is found over the sandy or muddy bottoms of the continental shelf at depths of  to  m  to   ft This species may vertically migrate in the water column because of changes in temperature Behavior The Japanese sawshark has a varied diet of small benthic organisms Like seemingly all sawsharks this species is ovoviviparous After an unknown gestation period the female shark gives live birth to around  pups These pups average around  cm  in long At sexual maturity the male is  to  cm  to  in long and the female is around  cm  in long Conservation With little information on population size or frequency of bycatch the Japanese sawshark is listed by the IUCN Red List as being Least Concern Due to its benthic lifestyle and because the range of this shark is heavily fished it is safe to assume that the Japanese sawshark is at considerable risk of being caught as bycatch in bottom trawling and gillnet operations Because of its habitat and behavior this shark poses no threat to humans

Asian sea bass family Lateolabracidae which is found in the Western Pacific Japanese names In the Kanto area Eastern Japan including Shizuoka Prefecture it is called Seigo when under cm At  years of age when it has attained a length of nearly cm it is called Fukko or Suzuki In Kansai Western Japan it is called Seigo Hane and Suzuki Description Head of Japanese sea bass The Japanese sea bass has a slightly forked tail and a large mouth which has the lower jaw protruding beyond the upper jaw The young fish have small black spots on the back and dorsal fin which tend to lost in larger fish Its body has  to  spines in the first dorsal followed by  to  soft rays in its second dorsal The anal fin has  spines and  to  soft rays The maximum recorded total length is  centimetres   ft although the more common standard length is   centimetres   in and the maximum published weight is   kilograms  lb Distribution The Japanese sea bass is found in the Western pacific where it occurs from Japan to the South China Sea Habitat and biology Japanese sea bass specimen in May  The Japanese sea bass occurs on inshore rocky reefs where there is a current The juveniles have been recorded ascending rivers and then return as adults to sea to spawn It is a protandrous hermaphrodite in which the fish reach sexual maturity as males at around  years old and change into females when they are older Japanese seabass larvae commence feeding at day  after hatching The diet of the early larvae is exclusively on smaller zooplankton such as cyclopoids and copepods with copepods being the dominant component in their diet making up nearly  Once they have reached the juvenile stage its diet includes sardines anchovies and shrimp as well as any other small fishes and crustaceous Reproduction and development The spawning of this species occurs in the coastal waters around Japan specifically in the shelf areas with a depth of m during late October to late January Generally Japanese sea bass eggs are distributed between bay water and outer water because thermohaline regions are formed However once their eggs have developed they are shifted from the surface layer to the middle layer of water The water temperature where the eggs are placed in a significant factor for the survival rate since their eggs do not tolerate temperatures below  C The eggs of this species are pelagic spherical colorless and measure about  mm to  mm in diameter with a single oil globule The transformation from the larva to the juvenile stage is around  to  days of age and juvenile stage begins at  days of age Migration Juveniles are dispersed and transported kilometers away from the spawning grounds into coastal areas and river estuaries by tidal currents during late winter or early spring Some of their nursery habitats are located around Japanese seas such as Tamara River estuary Tokyo Bay Tango sea Ariake Bay and Lake Shinji Most of the early juveniles migrate to the upriver turbidity maximum zone TMZ which is known as an area of high prey concentration in estuaries Juveniles that migrate to these areas have a better chance to survive than those who remain in coastal areas The area of estuaries is smaller and its environmental conditions are more variable allowing them to have higher growth rate a lower starvation rate and less risk of predation Taxonomy Lateolabrax maculatus has been treated as a junior synonym of L japonicus but more recent authorities have treated it as a valid species with a wide distribution in the Ariake Sea and off Nagasaki in Japan off the Chinese coast Taiwan and Korea normally off the southern and western coasts Usage Japanese sea bass being sold as food in Japan This species is important commercially popular as a game fish and farmed

Domain Eukaryota Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Actinopterygii Order Beloniformes Family Adrianichthyidae Genus Oryzias Species O latipes Binomial name Oryzias latipes Temminck Schlegel  Synonyms Poecilia latipes Temminck Schlegel  Aplocheilus latipes Temminck Schlegel  The Japanese rice fish Oryzias latipes also known as the medaka is a member of genus Oryzias ricefish the only genus in the subfamily Oryziinae This small up to about   cm or   in native of Japan is a denizen of rice paddies marshes ponds slow moving streams and tide pools It is euryhaline occurring in both brackish and freshwater It became popular as an aquarium fish because of its hardiness and pleasant coloration its coloration varies from creamy white to yellowish in the wild to white creamy yellow or orange in aquarium bred individuals Bright yellow red or green transgenic populations similar to GloFish have also been developed but are banned from sale in the EU The medaka has been a popular pet since the th century in Japan After fertilization the female carries her eggs attached anterior to the anal fin for a period before depositing them on plants or similar things Ecology Medaka live in small ponds shallow rivers and rice fields They can survive in a wide range of water temperatures   C or   F but they prefer a water temperature of   C   F Since they eat juvenile mosquitoes and small plankton they are known as a beneficial organism for humans They produce   eggs per birth and they can produce eggs every day in laboratory conditions They are seasonal breeding animals and usually lay eggs between spring and summer They prefer to lay eggs around water grass and often prefer living in rice fields The egg usually requires   days to hatch They have an advanced renal function which enables them to live in saltwater and brackish water The average life span of this species in the wild is estimated to be  years though in laboratory conditions they can survive   years They live in schools and they can recognize the faces of other individual medaka Taxonomy and range A group in a shallow ditch a typical habitat of the species Katori Japan As originally defined O latipes was native to much of east and mainland southeast Asia but in recent decades most of these populations have been split off as separate species based on morphological morphometrics and meristics and genetic evidence This limits the native range of definite O latipes to Japan eastern and southern Honshu Shikoku Kyushu and smaller southern islands in the country Formerly included in this species but now regarded as separate are O sakaizumii in northwestern Honshu in Japan locally it hybridizes with O latipes and O sinensis Chinese rice fish in much of China west Korea and parts of mainland southeast Asia The taxonomic position of certain populations including some in China Laos and east Korea is unclear and require further study It is possible that all these Chinese populations are part of O sinensis but the Laos specimens are relatively large similar to O latipes rather than the tiny O sinensis The east Korean population is part of a clade with O sakaizumii and O latipes Based on morphology it is closer to O sakaizumii than O latipes but it may be an undescribed species O latipes has been introduced to Hokkaido in northern Japan where ricefish are not native There are other reports of introductions around the world but at least most of those in mainland Asia and Europe involve O sinensis Chinese rice fish Origin of Southern and Northern Japanese populations Phylogenetic analysis shows that the southern Japanese population was derived from that of the northern Kyushu area and spread into Honshu On the other hand the northern population was derived from a population from the Tajima Tango region and spread alongside the Sea of Japan coast O latipes is known to have nine sub populations East Japanese type East Setouchi type West Setouchi type San in type Northern Kyushu type Osumi Type Ariake type Satsuma type and Ryukyu type These sub populations have been mixed with each other due to artificial releasing and decreasing local genetic diversity Use in science An orange aquarium variant himedaka achieved through selective breeding photographed from above Not to be confused with the brightly colored transgenic aquarium variants Oryzias latipes is a model organism and is extensively used in many areas of biological research most notably in toxicology Medaka have a short gestation period and are reproductively prolific characteristics that make them easy to rear in the laboratory They can withstand cold and can be shipped easily Nearly all aspects of the life cycle of medaka have been analyzed by researchers including sexual behavior genetic inheritance of coloration spawning habits feeding pathology embryological development ecology etc It has a relatively small genome  mega base pairs half the size of the genome of another popular model fish the zebrafish as well as a generation time of  weeks rather than  weeks for zebrafish and hardier growth in a broad temperature range   C or   F Transgenic medaka are relatively easy to produce They have been genetically modified to secrete various human hormones express promoter sequences from other fish and to make antimicrobial proteins and a protein that makes the medaka glow fluorescent green yellow or red There are also many mutations that show up in medaka at random for example a mutant strain that lacks scales and one with extra long fins Haploid embryonic stem cell lines have been established In space O latipes mating in space O latipes carries the distinction of having been the first vertebrate to mate in orbit The result of the mating was a brood of healthy fry hatched on the Space Shuttle Columbia in  O latipes returned to space in  launched aboard a Soyuz spacecraft Soyuz TMA M and housed in an aquarium aboard the International Space Station Inbreeding lines The possibility of serial inbreeding facilitates genetic research due to reduction of heterozygous sites in the genome In medaka it is relatively easy to establish inbred lines unlike other model species like zebrafish and mice By  researchers had generated  inbred strains These inbred lines made medaka a model species for scientific research in genetics In  work began on generating  different inbred lines derived from a single population collected in the wild Sex and reproduction Medaka reproduce on a daily basis which is an optimal trait for studying their reproductive biology Researchers have studied HPG axis activities intensively in this species Moreover the medaka is the first non mammalian vertebrate species for which a sex determination gene DMY has been identified their sex is reversible by sex steroid manipulation and they exhibit morphological sexual dimorphism between males and females Furthermore some methods such as ovariectomy and altered light dark cycles have been developed to study the mechanism of reproduction in medaka Immunology The discovery that T lymphocytes home to the thymus in medaka has led to an understanding that this is not specific to mammalians but can be found in other vertebrates Skeletal Research This species is increasingly used as a model in research relating to skeletal diseases in humans such as osteoporosis Conservation Status The medaka is listed as a least concern species in the IUCN red list The justification of this categorization is that this species is living in widespread habitat   km and is relatively abundant in its various habitats However it is considered an endangered species by Japan s Ministry of the Environment Many local communities try to preserve wild medaka in Japan Concerns There are two major concerns about medaka conservation habitat degradation and hybridization with domesticated medaka himedaka Due to modernization of rice fields and irrigation canals optimal places for medaka reproduction are massively decreasing In addition recent studies confirmed that himedaka have been introduced into many local regions by artificial release This will eliminate local genetic adaptations of each sub population of medaka Furthermore since himedaka have vivid orange body color the hybrids will attract more predators and thus decrease the total medaka population In  researchers discovered that almost  of wild caught medaka in Nara had a himedaka specific gene marker In addition to these concerns invasive species like mosquitofish compete with medaka by sharing the same habitat A study reported that over  of medaka had their tail fins injured by attacks from mosquitofish The damage at the anal fin will decrease medaka offspring by preventing courtship behavior In  it was found that a transgenic line of medaka was brought to Japan from Taiwan for commercial purposes This transgenic line had an introduced gene which expresses green fluorescence making the body glow Now this transgenic line has been released into the wild and is causing genetic pollution There is no comprehensive study of population size of medaka but the genomic analysis of one medaka sub population indicates that their effective population size is around   Medaka in Tokyo Japan Social importance in Japan The medaka has been kept as a domesticated pet in Japan for centuries In recent years the fish has gained further popularity with some rarer breeds valued at over  million yen approximately US   though the most common varieties like himedaka can be purchased for around  yen per fish Currently  commercial strains are documented and available for fishkeeping Medaka are not only kept as pets but also widely utilized in education Japanese elementary school classes often raise medaka in order to give the students firsthand experience with caring for live organisms as well as to foster more broad appreciation for animals life cycles See also Japan portalFish portal Mummichog

condiment made from fish or krill that have been coated in salt and fermented for up to two years  It is used as a staple seasoning in East Asian cuisine and Southeast Asian cuisine particularly Myanmar Cambodia Laos Philippines Thailand and Vietnam Some garum related fish sauces have been used in the West since the Roman times Due to its ability to add a savory umami flavor to dishes it has been embraced globally by chefs and home cooks The umami flavor in fish sauce is due to its glutamate content Fish sauce is used as a seasoning during or after cooking and as a base in dipping sauces Soy sauce is regarded by some in the West as a vegetarian alternative to fish sauce though they are very different in flavor  History Asia Sauces that included fermented fish parts with other ingredients such as meat and soy bean were recorded in China  years ago During the Zhou dynasty of ancient China fish fermented with soybeans and salt was used as a condiment By the time of the Han dynasty soy beans were fermented without the fish into soy paste and its by product soy sauce    with fermented fish based sauces developing separately into fish sauce A fish sauce called k echiap in Hokkien Chinese might be the precursor of ketchup  By   BC demand for fish sauces and fish pastes in China had fallen drastically with fermented bean products becoming a major trade commodity Fish sauce however developed massive popularity in Southeast Asia Food scholars traditionally divide East Asia into two distinct condiment regions separated by a bean fish divide Southeast Asia mainly using fermented fish Vietnam Thailand Cambodia and Northeast Asia using mainly fermented beans China Korea Japan Fish sauce re entered China in the th and th centuries brought from Vietnam and Cambodia by Chinese traders up the coast of the southern provinces Guangdong and Fujian Europe Fish sauces were widely used in ancient Mediterranean cuisine The earliest recorded production was between th rd century BC by the Ancient Greeks who fermented scraps of fish called garos into one  It is believed to have been made with a lower salt content than modern fish sauces The Romans made a similar condiment called either garum or liquamen  According to Pliny the Elder garum consists of the guts of fish and other parts that would otherwise be considered refuse so that garum is really the liquor from putrefaction Garum was made in the Roman outposts of Spain almost exclusively from mackerel by salting the scrap fish innards and then sun fermenting the flesh until it fell apart usually for several months The brown liquid would then be strained bottled and sold as a condiment Remains of Roman fish salting facilities can still be seen including in Algeciras in Spain and near Set bal in Portugal The process lasted until the th century when garum makers switched to anchovy and removed the innards  Garum was ubiquitous in Classical Roman cooking Mixed with wine it was known as oenogarum or with vinegar oxygarum or mixed with honey meligarum Garum was one of the trade specialties in Hispania Baetica Garum was frequently maligned as smelling bad or rotten being called for example evil smelling fish sauce and is said to be similar to modern colatura di alici a fish sauce used in Neapolitan cuisine In English garum was formerly translated as fish pickle The original Worcestershire sauce is a related product because it is fermented and contains anchovies Ruins of a Roman garum factory near Tarifa Spain Ancient Roman garum factory in Portugal Two amphoras for garum Difference from oyster sauce While fish sauce and oyster sauce are both briny and may have related histories they are different products Fish sauce is watery clear and salty whereas oyster sauce is made by reducing oyster extracts and therefore sweeter with a hint of salt and not as strong an aroma as fish sauce Ingredients and manufacture Fish sauce fermentation containers in Ph Qu c Vietnam Fish sauces historically have been prepared from different species of fish and shellfish and from using the whole fish or by using just fish blood or viscera Most modern fish sauces contain only fish and salt usually made from anchovy shrimp mackerel or other strong flavored high oil fish Some variants add herbs and spices For modern fish sauces fish or shellfish are mixed with salt at a concentration of  to  It is then sealed in a closed container for up to two years  Once the original draft has been made some fish sauces will be produced through a re extraction of the fish mass via boiling To improve the visual appearance and add taste second pass fish sauces often have added caramel molasses or roasted rice  They are thinner and less costly Some volume manufacturers of fish sauce will also water down a first press to manufacture more products Fish sauce that has been only briefly fermented has a pronounced fishy taste Extended fermentation reduces this and gives the product a nuttier richer and more savory flavor An anonymous article Neuc num in Diderot and d Alembert s th century Encyclop die states It is said that Europeans become accustomed enough to this type of sauce Regional variations Southeast Asia Southeast Asian fish sauce is often made from anchovies salt and water and is intensely flavoured Anchovies and salt are arranged in wooden barrels to ferment and are slowly pressed yielding the salty fishy liquid The salt extracts the liquid via osmosis Southeast Asians generally use fish sauce as a cooking sauce However there is a sweet and sour version of this sauce which is used more commonly as a dipping sauce Myanmar Fish sauce in Myanmar is called ngan bya yay It s often a by product of Hmyin ngapi Burmese Fish Paste made from small fish Cambodia In Cambodia fish sauce is called tik trei Khmer t k trei Just like prahok it is believed to date back to the pre Angkorean era Industrially fish sauce is produced by mixing trei aing keuy or anchovies with coarse salt and fermenting it in large wooden vats Over the period of six to eight months it is distilled five times before being transferred into jars and sun fermented for the final   months The most famous fish sauce is produced in the Kampot Province Food Production Company of Kampot produces a speciality fish sauce containing roe Fish sauce is mixed with sugar lime juice chili peppers and crushed roasted peanuts to create sweet fish sauce which is the most popular dipping sauce in Cambodia Cambodian sweet fish sauce mixed with chopped chili peppers and slices of garlic Laos In Lao Isan it is called nam pa Lao A chunkier more aromatic version known as padaek is also used Philippines Main articles Bagoong and Dayok The Philippine fish sauce is known as patis It is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine Patis is a by product of bagoong production which include bagoong isda fermented fish and bagoong alamang fermented krill as well as the rarer bagoong macabebe fermented oysters and bagoong sisi fermented clams The fish used are typically small like sardines anchovies ambassids and the fry of larger fish Unlike other fish sauce variants the fermented solids are not discarded but are sold as separate products The patis is skimmed from the upper layers of fermenting bagoong and is not pressed As such patis usually takes longer to produce than other types of fish sauce as it is reliant on the readiness of bagoong Patis is nearly always cooked prior to consumption even when used as an accent to salads or other raw dishes Patis is also used as an ingredient in cooked dishes including a rice porridge called arroz caldo and as a condiment for fried fish Patis is also used in place of table salt in meals to enhance the flavor of the food where it can either be dashed from a dispensing bottle onto the food or poured into a saucer and mixed with calamansi and labuyo chilis and used as a dipping sauce Traditional burnay jars containing fermenting bagoong in Ilocos Norte Commercial patis sold in the Philippines Dipping sauce made from patis with siling labuyo peppers Thailand Fish sauce in Thailand is called nam pla Thai In Isan it is called nam pa Similar to the Laotian padaek is pla ra Thai also used in Thai cuisine In Thailand fish sauce is used both in cooking and also served at the table as a condiment for instance in noodle soups Nearly every Thai meal is served with phrik nam pla as a condiment a mixture of fish sauce lime juice and chopped bird s eye chilies Sliced garlic is often added to this sauce Historically there were two types of fish sauce made in Thailand that made with a fresh water fish pla soi and sauce made from a salt water fish pla kratak Either fish is fermented for at least eight months three parts fish to two parts salt The resulting mash is filtered This yields the best fish sauce called the base The dregs are then mixed with water and salt and again fermented for three to four months This yields a second grade fish sauce mostly used in cooking In  the US Food and Drug Administration FDA banned the import of Thai fish sauces due to a lack of information about tests for botulinum toxin The toxin can cause death if more than   micrograms are consumed The Thai Office of Food Safety and Quality then tested  brands of fish sauce to determine the content of botulinum toxin in the products Of  brands tested  were genuine fish sauces from  production sites in  provinces Twenty samples from production sites in eight provinces were adulterated fish sauce Tests showed that none were contaminated with botulinum toxin types A B E and F and were free of Clostridium botulinum bacteria In  rumours again surfaced concerning banned Thai fish sauce Phrik nam pla fish sauce with chili is served with some Thai meals Prepared fish sauces in Thailand Vietnam See also N c ch m and M m n m The variety from Vietnam is called n c m m There are two areas in Vietnam that are most famous for producing fish sauce Ph Qu c and Phan Thi t Fish sauce has a  year history dating back to the Champa kingdom of the Cham people Phan Thi t can be identified with the birthplace of Vietnamese fish sauce Before  Phan Thi t was a territory of Champa The Vietnamese occupied the area in  and commercialized the fish sauce by keeping it in barrels and selling throughout the country This business was popularized by Tr n Gia H a who was born in  There is a fish sauce museum in Phan Thi t Popular brands in the US include Mega Chef Red Boat  Crabs Golden Boy and H n Phan Thi t Vietnamese fish sauces are made with anchovies mackerel scabbard fish and salt High mercury concentration can be found in larger fish especially in predator fish like scabbard fish They do not have any additives like sugar hydrolyzed protein or preservatives Vietnamese prefer sauces without a strong smell and transparent with a deep golden amber color First press fish sauce meaning the sauce is bottled from the first time the fermenting barrels are drained also indicates quality Lastly when measuring the nitrogen level of fish sauces N most fish sauce on the market falls within the mid N range Anything over N is considered high grade and N is optimal N c ch m is a Vietnamese prepared fish based condiment also referred to as a sauce that is savory lightly sweet and salty tasting and can be sour and spicy if lime and chili peppers are added The main components are fish sauce water and sugar M m is made much like fish sauce except that it is not fermented as long and the fish is kept along with its liquid extract not just the extract M m can be used as a base condiment in dipping sauces with additional ingredients or used in soups or stir fries In January  the Institute of Food Technologists published a study asserting that using Vietnamese fish sauce as a substitute for sodium chloride salt in chicken broth tomato sauce and coconut curry reduced the amount of sodium chloride by  to  percent while still maintaining the perceived deliciousness saltiness and overall flavor intensity This idea is similar to the use of umami flavor enhancers such as MSG to increase flavor intensity and reduce sodium requirement According to the General Statistics Office in  the output of fish sauce reached nearly  million liters According to the Vietnam Fish Sauce Association the output of fish sauce in  is expected to reach about  million liters The reason for this growth is due to the increasing domestic demand and the strong development of the fish sauce export industry Vietnamese fish sauce is currently exported to more than  countries and territories around the world According to statistics Vietnam currently has  fish sauce production facilities with   participating farming households producing about  million liters of fish sauce per year Of which  facilities produce fish sauce for export to  markets Fishing boats in Ph Qu c where the most prized

Peninsula is made from sardine and squid Shottsuru the best known type of Japanese fish sauce and often used as a synonym for all gyosh is from Akita Prefecture and is mainly made from sailfin sandfish Ikanago shoyu of Kagawa Prefecture is made from sand lance They are used in nabemono in salad dressings and as a flavoring ingredient in ramen soups Japanese fish sauces shottsuru and ishiru Korea In Korea fish sauce is called eojang Across the Korean Peninsula aekjeot literally liquid jeotgal a type of fish sauce usually made from fermented anchovies or sand lances is used as a crucial

glutinous rice from Japan Long grain glutinous rice from Thailand Glutinous rice flour Glutinous rice Oryza sativa var glutinosa also called sticky rice sweet rice or waxy rice is a type of rice grown mainly in Southeast and East Asia and the northeastern regions of South Asia which has opaque grains very low amylose content and is especially sticky when cooked It is widely consumed across Asia It is called glutinous Latin gl tin sus in the sense of being glue like or sticky and not in the sense of containing gluten which it does not While often called sticky rice it differs from non glutinous strains of japonica rice which also become sticky to some degree when cooked There are numerous cultivars of glutinous rice which include japonica indica and tropical japonica strains History The origins of glutinous rice is difficult to ascertain due to its long standing cultural importance across a wide geographical region in Asia It is most prevalent in the highland regions in Southeast Asia where it is a staple while it also serves as occasional festival food in East Asia mainly for desserts and parts of South Asia Glutinous rice is particularly associated with the upland agriculture of the Kra Dai speaking peoples of Mainland Southeast Asia A region of around   km   sq mi that includes Laos Myanmar Thailand Cambodia and Vietnam is sometimes known as the glutinous rice zone A  genetic study discovered that the waxy mutation that disrupted amylose synthesis likely has a single origin This is supported by the fact that all glutinous rice accessions in the study contain the same mutation From comparisons of subsequent mutations in the different accessions in the study it was found that the progenitor haplotype is highest among Southeast Asian glutinous rice cultivars indicating strongly that the waxy mutation first arose in Southeast Asia likely in the upland regions of Mainland Southeast Asia before spreading to the rest of Asia The waxy mutation is also known to have first arose in temperate japonica rice where it is far more common before spreading to tropical japonica rice javanica and indica cultivars via gene flow Cultivation Glutinous rice is grown in Laos Thailand Cambodia Vietnam Malaysia Indonesia Myanmar Nepal Bangladesh Bhutan Northeast India China Japan Korea Taiwan and the Philippines An estimated  of Lao rice production is of this type As of  approximately   glutinous rice varieties were collected from five continents Asia South America North America Europe and Africa where glutinous rice is grown for preservation at the International Rice Genebank IRGC The International Rice Research Institute IRRI has described Laos as a collector s paradise Laos has the largest biodiversity of sticky rice in the world IRRI trained collectors gathered more than   samples and   varieties from Laos alone Composition Glutinous rice is distinguished from other types of rice by having no or negligible amounts of amylose and high amounts of amylopectin the two components of starch Amylopectin is responsible for the sticky quality of glutinous rice The difference has been traced to a single mutation that farmers selected Like all types of rice glutinous rice does not contain dietary gluten i e does not contain glutenin and gliadin and should be safe for gluten free diets Glutinous rice can be used either milled or unmilled that is with the bran removed or not removed Milled glutinous rice is white and fully opaque unlike non glutinous rice varieties which are somewhat translucent when raw whereas the bran can give unmilled glutinous rice a purple or black colour Black and purple glutinous rice are distinct strains from white glutinous rice In developing Asia there is little regulation and some governments have issued advisories about toxic dyes being added to colour adulterated rice Both black and white glutinous rice can be cooked as discrete grains or ground into flour and cooked as a paste or gel Use in

gods and ancestors demi gods Rice cooked with it is also taken directly as lunch or dinner on rare occasions Similarly other indigenous communities from NE India use sticky rice in various forms similar to the native Assamese style in their cuisine Philippines In the Philippines glutinous rice is known as malagkit in Tagalog or pilit in Visayan among other names such as diket in Ilocano Both mean sticky The most common way glutinous rice is prepared in the Philippines is by soaking uncooked glutinous rice in water or coconut milk usually overnight and then grinding it into a thick paste traditionally with stone mills This produces a rich and smooth viscous rice dough known as galap ng which is the basis for numerous rice cakes in the Philippines However in modern preparation methods galapong is sometimes made directly from dry glutinous rice flour or from commercial Japanese mochiko with poorer quality results Galapong was traditionally allowed to ferment which is still required for certain dishes A small amount of starter culture of microorganisms tapay or bubod or palm wine tub may be traditionally added to rice being soaked to hasten the fermentation These can be substituted with yeast or baking soda in modern versions Other versions of galapong may also be treated with wood ash lye Aside from the numerous white and red glutinous rice cultivars the most widely used glutinous rice heirloom cultivars in the Philippines are tapol rice which is milky white in colour and pirurutong rice which ranges in colour from black to purple to reddish brown However both varieties are expensive and becoming increasingly rare thus some Filipino recipes nowadays substitute it with dyed regular glutinous rice or infuse purple yam ube to achieve the same colouration Dessert delicacies in the Philippines are known as kakanin from kanin prepared rice These were originally made primarily from rice but in recent centuries the term has come to encompass dishes made from other types of flour including corn flour masa cassava wheat and so on Glutinous rice figures prominently in two main subtypes of kakanin the puto steamed rice cakes and the bibingka baked rice cakes Both largely utilize glutinous rice galapong A notable variant of puto is puto bumbong which is made with pirurutong Other kakanin that use glutinous rice include suman biko and sapin sapin among others There is also a special class of boiled galapong dishes like palitaw moche mache and masi Fried galapong is also used to make various types of buchi which are the local Chinese Filipino versions of jian dui They are also used to make puso which are boiled rice cakes in woven leaf pouches Aside from kakanin glutinous rice is also used in traditional Filipino rice gruels or porridges known as lugaw They include both savory versions like arroz caldo or goto which are similar to Chinese style congee and dessert versions like champorado binignit and ginataang mais Filipino glutinous rice dishes Puto steamed rice cakes made with fermented galapong Bibingka made from baked galapong with coconut milk Cuchinta glutinous rice cakes made with lye Puto bumbong steamed rice cakes made

rice or uruchimai is the staple of the Japanese diet and consists of short translucent grains When cooked it has a sticky texture such that it can easily be picked up and eaten with chopsticks Outside Japan it is sometimes labeled sushi rice as this is one of its common uses It is also used to produce sake Glutinous rice known in Japan as mochigome is used for making mochi Okowa and special dishes such as sekihan It is a short grain rice and can be distinguished from uruchimai by its particularly short round opaque grains its greater stickiness when cooked and firmer and chewier texture Cultivation Main article Rice production in Japan Contemporary cultivation of rice in Japan is characterized by high mechanization intense cultivation and a shortage of farmland Terraced rice fields cover many rural hillsides and are relatively small due to mountainous terrain and government controls on farmland consolidation Cultivars A comparison between Koshihikari and Calrose cultivars Koshihikari on the left Calrose on the right Koshihikari is a particularly esteemed cultivar and one of the most commonly grown in Japan Akitakomachi is also quite popular Sasanishiki is a cultivar known for keeping the same taste when cooled down Yamada Nishiki is the most famous cultivar grown specifically for sake In Hokkaid Japan s northernmost prefecture hardier cultivars such as Oborozuki and Yumepirika have been developed to withstand the colder climate Calrose is the name used originally for a medium grain Japonica cultivar developed in  and now as a generic term for California medium grain Japonicas While not true Japanese rice Calrose type rice has been grown by Japanese American producers in California for many years It is commonly used to prepare Japanese cuisine in North America and is reasonably good as a sushi rice It is also exported to a number of countries including Japan although it has not gained much popularity with Japanese consumers In recent years

Aminobutyric acid content It has a softer texture than ordinary brown rice and a pleasant fragrance It is sold in Japanese supermarkets but it can also be made at home Some high end rice cookers have a GABA rice setting to automate the process Haigamai is rice that has been partially milled to remove most of the bran but leave the germ intact It takes less time to cook than brown rice but retains more of the vitamins than white rice Coin operated automated rice polishing machines called seimaijo for polishing brown rice are a common sight in rural Japan The rice polishing machines typically polish a  kg amount for  yen The by product of the polishing process rice bran komenuka is used commercially as the source of rice bran oil It may also be used for making a kind of pickle called nukazuke as an organic fertilizer and in livestock feed Most supermarkets in Japan sell ready polished rice in  kg  kg and smaller bags Brown rice is usually sold in  kg bags which may be generally polished by the consumer in a coin operated polishing machine or in smaller bags in supermarkets intended for eating as brown rice Musenmai or no wash rice is white rice which has been further processed to remove a sticky coating called the hada nuka or skin bran which is normally removed by rinsing the rice prior to cooking for better taste and aroma The manufacturing process involves tumbling the rice in a tube for a short duration causing the bran to stick to the sides of the tube The process notably does not use water which is significant because water from rinsing rice is a big

Preparation Cooked Japanese rice served in Wajima nuri lacquerware Most Japanese use suihanki rice cookers to which measured amounts of washed rice and water are added The rice is first washed to release excess starch Then before cooking it is usually soaked in water for between half an hour in summer and two hours in winter Soaking times also depend on the quality and freshness of the rice The rice is then boiled using a ratio of about five parts of water to four parts of rice though with fresher rice the ratio can go down to  to  After this it is steamed until the centre of the rice becomes soft Salt is not added to the rice Most modern rice cookers include a cooking delay timer so that rice placed in the cooker at night will be ready for the morning meal The rice cooker can also

Music Painting Sports Theatre Video gaming Symbols Flag Coat of arms Anthem World Heritage Sites Russia portalvte Russian cuisine is a collection of the different dishes and cooking traditions of the Russian people as well as a list of culinary products popular in Russia with most names being known since pre Soviet times coming from all kinds of social circles History Pelmeni boiled dumplings with meat filling Caviar a delicacy that is very popular in Russian culture The history of Russian cuisine was divided in four groups Old Russian cuisine ninth to sixteenth century Old Moscow cuisine seventeenth century the cuisine that existed during the ruling of Peter and Catherine the Great eighteenth century and finally Petersburg cuisine which took place from the end of the eighteenth century to the s In the Old Russian period the main food groups were bread grains and other foods that contained starch Women baked pies with many different fillings such as mushrooms or berries During gatherings a loaf of bread and salt was always present Kasha such as buckwheat and oats were represented as wellbeing to the household Many Russians used honey and berries and made them into gingerbread which is still a popular Russian dessert Many current Russian dishes were inspired from Asian cultures such as pelmeni In the seventeenth century cuisine was separated based on economic class The rich had meat and delicacies such as caviar while the poor had the most simple dishes During this century more food appeared because new countries were annexed During the Peter and Catherine the Great era minced meat was incorporated into dishes and other European countries cuisine was also mixed into Russian foods In the last era Petersburg cuisine many French German Dutch and Italian meals were incorporated into Russian foods such as lamb and pork The French popularized potatoes and tomatoes in dishes Due to the long lasting cold weather in Russia many dishes were made to be preserved so they would not have to take extra trips in the freezing snowy days Its foundations were laid by the peasant food of the rural population in an often harsh climate with a combination of plentiful fish pork poultry caviar mushrooms berries and honey Crops of rye wheat barley and millet provided the ingredients for a plethora of breads pancakes pies cereals beer and vodka Soups and stews are centered on seasonal or storable produce fish and meats Such food remained the staple for the vast majority of Russians well into the th century The th through th centuries brought more refined culinary techniques It was during this time period that smoked meats and fish pastry cooking salads and green vegetables chocolate ice cream wines and juice were imported from abroad At least for the urban aristocracy and provincial gentry this opened the doors for the creative integration of these new foodstuffs with traditional Russian dishes In the early th century the Revolution saw a rapid decline of elite cuisine driven both by the new egalitarian state ideology and by disappearance of the old Imperial elites who used to be its consumers The distinct Soviet cuisine was born emphasizing fusion of the Union s national cuisines scientific approach to a diet and industrial approach to food preparation and serving The fall of the Soviet Union saw the end of state monopoly on food service and a corresponding diversification of cuisine As average prosperity grew starting with the second decade after the collapse so did the demand for fresh culinary experiences prompting a renaissance of Imperial era elite cuisine as well as a wide search for novelty local specialties and creative reinterpretations leading to the birth of what has been dubbed the New Russian cuisine Ethnic and regional variations and influences The national Russian cuisine has evolved in a multicultural and multiethnic state with strong mutual influence from the cuisines of other ethnic groups that live within the nation s borders or had been a part of the Russian state historically Despite such deep mutual influence many national cuisines within the borders of the Russian Federation maintain their uniqueness such as Tatar cuisine Sakha cuisine or Yamal cuisine The Russian cuisine itself is also geographically diverse its variations dependent on raw materials and cooking methods available locally In the north of Russia it incorporates local berries such as cloudberry or crowberry fish such as cod game meat such as elk or even edible moss known as yagel Conversely in Siberia it includes the local fish varieties particularly those of the coregonus genus such as arctic cisco or muksun and borrows the local cooking methods to result in raw fish eaten frozen or combined with spices Further east local specialties are added such as eagle fern kolomikta fruit scallops and Kamchatka crabs Soups Soups have always played an important role in Russian cuisine The traditional staple of soups such as shchi borscht ukha rassolnik solyanka botvinya okroshka and tyurya was enlarged in the th to th centuries by both European and Central Asian staples like clear soups pureed soups stews and many others Russian soups can be divided into at least seven large groups Chilled soups based on kvass such as tyurya okroshka and botvinya Light soups and stews based on water and vegetables such as svekolnik Noodle soups with meat mushrooms or milk Soups based on cabbage most prominently shchi Thick soups based on meat broth with a salty sour base like rassolnik and solyanka Fish soups such as ukha Grain and vegetable based soups Cold soups Okroshka is a cold soup based on kvass or less frequently various kinds of sour milk kefir is often preferred nowadays Okroshka is also a salad The main ingredients are two types of vegetables that can be mixed with cold boiled meat or fish in a   proportion Thus vegetable meat poultry and fish varieties of okroshka are made There are typically two types of vegetables in okroshka The first must have a neutral taste such as boiled potatoes turnips rutabagas carrots or fresh cucumbers The second must be spicy and aromatic like radishes or green onion as well as other herbs greens of dill parsley chervil celery or tarragon Different meat and poultry can be used in the same soup The most common ingredient is beef alone or with poultry A mild bologna like sausage is sometimes used If it is made with fish the best choice would be tench European perch pike perch cod or other neutral tasting fish In the coastal areas smoked and or salted salmon is preferred instead often in combination with other meats The kvass most commonly used in cooking is white okroshka kvass which is much more sour than drinking kvass Spices used include mustard black pepper and pickled cucumber specifically the liquid from the pickles solely or in combination For the final touch boiled eggs and smetana similar to cr me fra che are added Often the mustard chopped hard boiled yolks pepper and pickle brine are combined into a spicy sauce that is added to the soup to taste For sour milk based okroshka well shaken natural sour milk often with the addition of seed oil is used with the addition of pure water and ground garlic Sometimes manufactured kefir is used instead of natural sour milk for time saving reasons though some say it detracts from the original taste of okroshka Tyurya is very similar to okroshka the main difference being that instead of vegetables bread sometimes with addition of onion and vegetable oil is soaked in kvass similar to Silesian wodzionka or Portuguese a orda It was commonly consumed during rough times such as the Russian Revolution World War I and World War II and by poor peasants Also due to its simplicity it was very common as a meal during religious fasting Botvinya is another type of cold soup The name of the soup comes from the Russian word botva which means leafy tops of root vegetables and true to its name it is made with the leafy tops of young beets as well as sorrel scallions dill cucumbers and two types of kvass Mustard garlic and horseradish are then added for flavor The vegetables are blanched then rubbed through a sieve and kvass is poured over them Svyokolnik also known as kholodnik is a cold borscht It consists of beet sour or beet juice blended with sour cream buttermilk soured milk kefir or yogurt The mixture has a distinctive orange or pink color It is served chilled typically over finely chopped beetroot cucumbers radishes and spring onion together with halved hard boiled eggs and sprinkled with fresh dill Chopped veal ham or crawfish tails may be added as well Okroshka Svekolnik Hot soups Shchi cabbage soup had been the predominant first course in Russian cuisine for over a thousand years Shchi knew no social class boundaries and even if the rich had richer ingredients and the poor made it solely of cabbage and onions all these poor and rich variations were cooked in the same tradition The unique taste of this cabbage soup was from the fact that after cooking it was left to draw stew in a Russian stove The spirit of shchi was inseparable from a Russian izba log hut Many Russian proverbs are connected to this soup such as Shchi da kasha pishcha nasha Russian Shchi and porridge are our staples It can be eaten regularly and at any time of the year The richer variant of shchi includes several ingredients but the first and last components are a must Cabbage Meat very rarely fish or mushrooms Carrots basil or parsley roots Spicy herbs onions celery dill garlic pepper bay leaf Sour components smetana apples sauerkraut pickle water When this soup is served smetana is added It is eaten with rye bread Older tradition called for thickening shchi with a sort of roux made by scalding a portion of the flour with a boiling broth without frying it first to increase the soup s caloric content especially if the meat was not used but about late XVIII century and especially in the higher class cooking this was abandoned for the sake of the finer taste During much of the year when the Orthodox Christian Church prescribes abstinence from meat and dairy a vegan version of shchi is made Kislye sour schi are made from pickled cabbage sauerkraut serye grey schi from the green outer leaves of the cabbage head Zelyonye green schi are made from sorrel leaves not cabbage and used to be a popular summer soup Borscht is made of broth beets and tomatoes with various vegetables including onions cabbage tomato carrots and celery Borscht usually includes meat particularly beef in Russia and pork in Ukraine Borscht is generally served very hot with sour cream chopped chives or parsley and crushed garlic Borscht is traditionally served with black bread Borscht is associated as national cuisine in various different Eastern European countries such as Ukraine Poland Belarus and Lithuania Ukha is a warm watery fish dish however calling it a fish soup would not be absolutely correct Ukha as a name for fish broth was established only in the late th to early th centuries In earlier times this name was first given to thick meat broths and then later chicken Beginning from the th century fish was more and more often used to prepare ukha thus creating a dish that had a distinctive taste among soups A minimum of vegetables is added in preparation and in classical cooking ukha was simply a rich fish broth served to accompany fish pies rasstegai kuliebiaka etc These days it is more often a fish soup cooked with potatoes and other vegetables A wide variety of freshwater fish is traditionally used Rassolnik is a hot soup in a salty sour cucumber base This dish formed in Russian cuisine quite late only in the th century About this time the name rassolnik was attached to it originating from the Russian word rassol which means brine pickle water Pickle water was known to be used as a base for soups from the th century at the latest Its concentration and ratio with other liquids and soup components gave birth to different soups solyanka shchi and of course rassolnik The latest is moderately sour salty soups on pickled cucumber base Some are vegetarian but more often with products like veal or beef kidneys or all poultry giblets stomach liver heart neck feet For best taste there has to be a balance between the sour part and neutral absorbers cereals potatoes root vegetables Typical rassolnik is based on kidneys brine and pickles vegetables and barley Kal ya was a very common dish first served in the th th centuries Subsequently it almost completely disappeared from Russian cuisine Often it was incorrectly called fish rassolnik The cooking technique is mostly the same as of ukha but to the broth were added pickled cucumbers pickle water lemons and lemon juice either separately or all together The main characteristic of kal ya is that only fat rich fish was used sometimes caviar was added along with the fish More spices are added and the soup turns out more piquant and thicker than ukha Formerly kal ya was considered a festivity dish Solyanka is a thick piquant soup that combines components from shchi cabbage smetana and rassolnik pickle water and cucumbers spices such as olives capers tomatoes lemons lemon juice kvass salted and pickled mushrooms make up a considerably strong sour salty base of the soup Solyanka is much thicker than other soups about   less liquid ratio Three types are distinguished meat fish and simple solyanka The first two are cooked on strong meat or fish broths and the last on mushroom or vegetable broth All the broths are mixed with cucumber pickle water Lapsha noodle soup was adopted by Russians from Tatars and after some transformation became widespread in Russia It comes in three variations chicken mushroom and milk Cooking all three is simple including preparation of noodles cooking of corresponding broth and boiling of noodles in broth Noodles are based on the same wheat flour or buckwheat wheat flour mix Mixed flour noodles go better with mushroom or milk broth Shchi Borscht Ukha Solyanka Salads Olivier salad also known as Russian salad is a mayonnaise based potato salad distinguished by its diced texture and the contrasting flavors of pickles hard boiled eggs boiled carrots boiled potatoes meat and peas This dish is one of the main features of New Year buffets Sel edka pod shuboy or shuba from Russian lit fur coat also known as dressed herring is chopped salted herring under a coat of shredded cooked beet sometimes with a layer of egg or other vegetables Vinegret from French vinaigrette is a salad made of boiled beets potatoes carrots pickles onions sauerkraut and sometimes peas or white beans It is dressed with sunflower or

the second course or served cold particularly in jellied stock such as kholodets below offal dishes liver tripe etc baked in pots together with cereals whole fowl dishes or parts of fowl legs or breasts or a large piece of meat rump baked on a baking tray in an oven so called zharkoye from the word zhar meaning heat at affluent households also mentions sausage making spit roasted meats stews and many other meat dishes As a garnish to meat dishes in the past the most common were porridges and cereals in which the meat was boiled later on boiled or rather steamed and baked root vegetables turnips carrots as well as mushrooms additionally the meat without taking account its type was garnished with pickled products pickled cabbage or sour and soaked marinated apples mochoniye yabloki or cranberries Pan juices alone or mixed with sour cream or melted butter were used as gravy to pour on garnishing vegetables and porridges Meat sauces i e gravies based on flour butter eggs and milk are not common for traditional Russian cuisine Pelmeni are a traditional Eastern European mainly Russian dish usually made with minced meat filling wrapped in thin dough made out of flour and eggs sometimes with milk or water added For filling pork lamb beef or any other kind of meat can be used mixing several kinds is popular The traditional Ural recipe requires the filling be made with  of beef  of lamb and  of pork Traditionally various spices such as pepper onions and garlic are mixed into the filling Russians seem to have learned to make pelmeni from Finno Ugric people The word means ear shaped bread in Finno Ugric languages such as Udmurt and Komi pel means ear and n an means bread In Siberia they were made in large quantities and stored safely frozen outside for several winter months In mainland Russia the term Siberian pel meni refers to pel meni made with a mix of meats whether the    mix mentioned above or another ratio rather than a single meat By the late th century they became a staple throughout urban European Russia They are prepared immediately before eating by boiling in water until they float and then   minutes more The resulting dish is served with butter or sour cream mustard horseradish and vinegar are popular as well Some recipes suggest frying pelmeni after boiling until they turn golden brown Pelmeni belong to the family of dumplings They are akin to vareniki a Ukrainian variety of dumplings with a filling made of most commonly mashed potatoes farmer s cheese or cherries They are not dissimilar to Chinese potstickers Tibetan mo mo and Italian ravioli as well as the manti of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz cultures The main difference between pelmeni and other kinds of dumplings is in their shape and size the typical pelmen is roughly spherical and is about  to  cm in diameter whereas most other types of dumplings are usually elongated and much larger The process of making pelmeni is somewhat labor intensive but a pelmennitsa greatly speeds up the task This device typically consists of a round aluminum plate with a matrix of holes surrounded by ridges A sheet of dough is placed over the matrix a filling is scooped into each cell and the dough sags under the weight of the filling forming the body of the dumpling Another sheet of dough is placed on top and a wooden roller is rolled over the top pressing the dough layers together cutting the dumplings apart by the ridges and forcing the dumplings to fall through the holes Using a pelmennitsa the chef can quickly manufacture batches of dumplings at a time Various minced meat dishes were adopted from other cuisines and became popular only in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries for traditional Russian cuisine they are not typical Kotlety minced cutlets are pan fried cutlet shaped patties not dissimilar from Salisbury steak and other such dishes Kotlety are made from pork and beef or from chicken sometimes also from fish In common recipes ground meat pork onions and bread are put in a bowl and mixed thoroughly until it becomes relatively consistent Once this effect is achieved patties are formed and then put into a hot frying pan to cook Pozharsky cutlet is a more elaborated version which was adopted by French haute cuisine Beef Stroganoff Saut ed pieces of beef served in a sauce with smetana sour cream From its origins in mid th century Russia it has become popular around the world with considerable variation from the original recipe Shashlyk is a form of shish kebab marinated meat grilled on a skewer popular in former Soviet Union countries notably in Georgia Russia Armenia Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan It often features alternating slices of meat and onions Even though the word shashlyk was apparently borrowed from the Crimean Tatars by the Cossacks as early as the th century kebabs did not reach Moscow until the late th century according to Vladimir Gilyarovsky s Moscow and Moscovites From then on their popularity spread rapidly by the s they were a staple in St Petersburg restaurants and by the s they were already a ubiquitous street food all over urban Russia Shashlik is also used in Russia as a food to be cooked in an outdoor environment similarly to barbecue in English speaking countries Kholodets or studen Jellied chopped pieces of pork or veal meat with some spices added pepper parsley garlic bay leaf and minor amounts of vegetables carrots onions The meat is boiled in large pieces for long periods of time then chopped boiled a few times again and finally chilled for   hours hence the name forming a jelly mass though gelatin is not used because calves feet pigs heads and other such offal is gelatinous enough on its own It is served with horseradish mustard or ground garlic with smetana Gulyash is also a very popular dish in Russia Of course this is the Austro Hungarian dish Goulash originally but it was still very popular in the USSR It had its place in domestic cuisine and was served in Soviet canteens in plants and factories Pelmeni Chicken cutlets Chicken Kiev Beef Stroganoff served with rice Shashlyk Kholodets Fish Fish was important in pre revolutionary cuisine especially on Russian Orthodox fast days when meat was forbidden similar to the Catholic custom of eating fish instead of meat on Fridays Strictly freshwater fish such as carp and sudak Sander lucioperca Zander were commonly eaten in inland areas as well as anadromous sturgeon and in northern areas salmon pike and trout A greater variety of fish including saltwater species were preserved by salting pickling or smoking and consumed as zakuski hors d oeuvres Caviar butterbrot Pan fried crucian carps Pickled herring with sour cream chives potatoes and egg Selyodka pod shuboi dressed herring There is a dish in modern Russian cuisine resembling a mix of svekolnik and pickled herring selyodka pod shuboi literally coated dressed herring where pickled herring is coated with a layer of potatoes a layer of mayo and or smetana sour cream with grated beet added on top for coating hence fur coat word shuba Vegetables Cabbage potatoes and cold tolerant greens are common in Russian and other Eastern European cuisines Pickling cabbage sauerkraut cucumbers tomatoes and other vegetables in brine is used to preserve vegetables for winter use Pickled apples and some other fruit also used to be widely popular These are sources of vitamins during periods when fresh fruit and vegetables are traditionally not available Pickled tomatoes Pickles Eastern European style sauerkraut Desserts and pastries Further

yeast dough or short pastry They are filled with one of many different fillings and are either baked the ancient Slavic method or shallow fried known as priazhenie this method was borrowed from the Tatars in the th century One feature of pirozhki that sets them apart from for example English pies is that the fillings used are almost invariably fully cooked The use of chopped hard boiled eggs in fillings is another interesting feature Six typical fillings for traditional pirozhki are Chopped boiled meat mixed with saut ed onions Rice and boiled eggs with dill Fish saut ed with onions and mixed with hard boiled chopped eggs and rice Mashed potatoes mixed with dill and green onion Saut ed cabbage Saut ed mushrooms with onions and sometimes carrots Polish pierogi type dumplings are not

as the last week of dairy and egg products before Lent Bliny are still often served at wakes to commemorate the recently deceased Blini can be made from wheat buckwheat or other grains although wheat blini are most popular in Russia The word blin is also often used as a soft curse word expressing frustration This practice originates from the word s phonetic similarity to the much more vulgar word

challenged and removed May  Learn how and when to remove this template message Many traditional drinks are indigenous to Russia and are not present in other national cuisines The most notable of these are vodka sbiten kvass medovukha and mors Many of them are no longer common and have been replaced by drinks originating in Europe Nonetheless these beverages were formerly drunk as a complement to meat and poultry dishes sweet porridge and dessert Of particular note is sbiten an immensely popular medieval drink which has since been replaced by tea as the Russian mainstay beverage Alcoholic Russian vodkas in various bottles and cups Of Russia s alcoholic beverages perhaps the most ancient is Medovukha a sweet low alcohol drink made with fermented honey with the addition of various spices A stronger honey based beverage stavlenniy myod also exists in Russia and is broadly equivalent to Scandinavian mead it is typically made with the admixture of berry juices Vodka is the best known of Russia s alcoholic products and is produced with some variation throughout the country Vodka can be either grain or potato based and is frequently flavored with a great variety of ingredients ranging from hot pepper and horseradish to fruits and berries Beer has been manufactured in Russia since at the very least the th century Its popularity was for many centuries concentrated in the Lands of Novgorod Beer continued to be made throughout Russian history but real growth came in the th century when many breweries were founded in order to supply the newly modernized and expanded imperial army and fleet A real explosion in the popularity of beer came in the last decades of the Soviet Era and has continued into the present day with Russia now ranking as the fourth largest producer in the world Wine is manufactured in the southern regions in the country but lags far behind other alcoholic beverages in popularity The wine industry which was somewhat notable in imperial times is slowly expanding but most Russians that drink wine tend to prefer imported foreign varieties especially sweet varieties produced in the countries of the former USSR and little known in the outside world Non alcoholic Most non alcoholic Russian drinks are based on fruits and berries Those include kompot made by boiling fruit with sweetened water uzvar in which dried fruit is used instead mors made of berries such as lingonberry cranberry blueberries or raspberries and kisel a viscous fruit drink thickened with cornstarch potato starch or arrowroot Kvass is a bread based drink and a key ingredient in many soups Kvass is an ancient and still widely popular bread based drink The basic method of preparing kvass includes water flour and liquid malt these ingredients are used to make a dough that is subjected to fermentation This results in a beverage with very low alcohol content Commercial kvass is often around   alcohol The fermented liquid referred to as zator is diluted with water and mixed with yeast sugar and aromatic additives This final mixture is allowed to brew for several days Flavor additives may include fruit and berry juices cherry raspberry lemon etc as well as ginger and mint Sbiten another non alcoholic drink is made of honey water fruit juices and spices Sbiten was once the most popular non alcoholic beverage in the country but in the last few centuries it has been superseded and largely replaced by tea and coffee Tea is by far the most common drink in almost all parts of Russia First introduced from China in the th century its popularity has since spread throughout the country Black tea has always been the dominant variety but after the Russian acquisition of Central Asia awareness of and interest in green tea began to increase slowly Today Russia remains one of the largest tea consumers in the world Russian Caravan is perhaps the most well known type of Russian tea around the world Until the Sino Soviet split tea was mostly brought in from China Now Russia imports most of its tea from India and Sri Lanka with Darjeeling being the most prized variety Domestic cultivation exists in the southern regions of the country mostly in Krasnodar Krai but local supply is very limited compared to national consumption Coffee is also popular but has never caught up to tea in popularity Peter the Great is credited with introducing coffee to Russia with the drink becoming steadily more pervasive since that time Coffee is commonly made either using the Turkish or common European methods Gallery Russian cuisine on a postage stamp sheet of Russia

URLDownload QR codeWikidata item Print export Download as PDFPrintable version From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Caviar made of the roe of the beluga sturgeon Huso huso Black beluga caviar Beluga caviar is caviar consisting of the roe or eggs of the beluga sturgeon Huso huso The fish is found primarily in the Caspian Sea which is bordered by Iran Azerbaijan Kazakhstan Russia and Turkmenistan It can also be found in the Black Sea basin and occasionally in the Adriatic Sea Beluga caviar is the most expensive type of caviar with market prices ranging from   to   kg   to   lb Harvesting The beluga sturgeon is currently considered to be critically endangered causing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to ban in  the importation of beluga caviar which originated in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea basin In  the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES suspended all trade made with the traditional caviar producing regions of the Caspian and Black Seas Beluga Ossetra and Sevruga Azerbaijan Bulgaria China Iran Kazakhstan Romania Russia Serbia and Montenegro Turkmenistan and Ukraine due to the producing countries failure to apply international regulations and recommendations Caviar from Iran is exempted from the ban Iran is considered by CITES to practise effective conservation and policing of its fisheries In January  this ban was partly lifted allowing the sale of  tons of caviar  percent below the official  level CITES maintained the  quotas for  drawing criticism for doing little to protect the declining sturgeon population The beluga sturgeon can take up to  years to reach maturity The fish harvested for caviar are often nearly  kg   lb The eggs themselves are the largest of the commonly used roes and range in color from dark gray almost black to light gray with the lighter colors coming from older fish and being the most valued The most expensive caviar is Almas a golden caviar produced by very rare female albino sturgeon between  and  years old which swims in the southern Caspian Sea near Iran where apparently less pollution exists Very few of the albino variety are left in the wild since the lack of melanin is a genetic disorder that only affects a few members of the species A kilogram  lb  oz is regularly sold for   USD    Any additions by producers diminish the value of the roe and the caviar usually reaches the market without any additions or processing whatsoever Legality In  the United States made it illegal to import beluga caviar and beluga sturgeon into the country because of the animal s endangered status However caviar from beluga hybrid species are still for sale in the country Many other countries allow for the import and export of beluga sturgeon caviar as the fish has started making a comeback in recent years Widespread farming and conservation efforts have allowed wild populations in the Caspian to redevelop In July  Sturgeon Aquafarms in Bascom FL became the first and only facility in the world to obtain a permit exemption for the trade in beluga sturgeon and its caviar in the USA Since  Sturgeon Aquafarms has assisted in beluga sturgeon repopulation efforts across the world by providing over   fertilized beluga eggs to the Caspian Sea region Service As with most caviars beluga is usually handled with a caviar spoon made of mother of pearl bone or other nonmetallic material as metal utensils are said to impart an unwelcome metallic taste to the delicate roe Beluga caviar is usually served by itself on toast unlike other less expensive caviars that can be served in a variety of ways including hollowed and cooked new potatoes on blini or garnished with sour cream cr me fra che chopped onions or minced hard boiled egg whites These items can however be served with beluga as palate cleansers References Expensive ingredients Top  world s most expensive ingredients Yahoo Lifestyle India Archived from the original on  June  Retrieved  July

of the caviar The rarest and most expensive form of caviar comes from the critically endangered beluga sturgeon that swims in the Caspian Sea Caviar also known as caviare originally from Persian romanized kh vy r lit egg bearing is a food consisting of salt cured roe of the family Acipenseridae Caviar is considered a delicacy and is eaten as a garnish or spread Traditionally the term caviar refers only to roe from wild sturgeon in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea beluga ossetra and sevruga caviars The term caviar can also describe the roe of other species of sturgeon or other fish such as paddlefish salmon steelhead trout lumpfish whitefish or carp The roe can be fresh non pasteurized or pasteurized which reduces its culinary and economic value Terminology Beluga caviarRussian and Iranian caviar tins Beluga to the left Ossetra in middle Sevruga to the rightOssetra caviar salmon creme fraiche potato shallot croquette basil oil egg whites and yolks Trout roe with bread According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization roe from any fish not belonging to the Acipenseriformes order including Acipenseridae or sturgeon sensu stricto and Polyodontidae or paddlefish are not caviar but substitutes of caviar This position is also adopted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora the World Wide Fund for Nature the United States Customs Service and France The term caviar is sometimes used to describe dishes that are perceived to resemble caviar such as eggplant caviar made from eggplant and Texas caviar made from black eyed peas History Caviar and sturgeon from the Sea of Azov began reaching the tables of aristocratic and noble Greeks in the th century after the commencement of large scale trading between the Byzantine Empire and Kievan Rus Varieties The main types of caviar from sturgeon species native to the Caspian Sea are Beluga Sterlet Kaluga hybrid Ossetra Siberian sturgeon and Sevruga American White Sturgeon caviar is abundant and native to California and the U S Pacific Northwest The rarest and costliest is from beluga sturgeon that swim in the Caspian Sea which is bordered by Iran Kazakhstan Russia Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan Wild caviar production was suspended in Russia between  and  to allow wild stocks to replenish Azerbaijan and Iran also allow the fishing of sturgeon off their coasts Beluga caviar is prized for its soft extremely large pea size eggs It can range in colour from pale silver grey to black It is followed by the small golden sterlet caviar which is rare and was once reserved for Russian Iranian and Austrian royalty Next in quality is the medium sized light brown to rich brown Ossetra also known as Russian caviar Others in the quality ranking are the grey sevruga caviar the Chinese Kaluga caviar and the American white sturgeon caviar The Siberian variety with black beads is similar to sevruga and is popular because of its reduced five years harvest period but it has a higher brine content than other kinds The Chinese Kaluga hybrid varies in colour from dark grey to light golden green and is a close cousin of beluga caviar Quality factors and cost An expensive caviar example at  kilogram   lb sold for   then US   is the Iranian Almas product from Persian diamond produced from the eggs of a rare albino sturgeon between  and  years old from the southern Caspian Sea Wild beluga sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea was priced in  at   per  kilogram  oz Cheaper alternatives have been developed from the roe of whitefish and the North Atlantic salmon Conventional sturgeon caviar was priced in  at about  per  ounce  g and from albino sturgeon up to  per ounce Other quality factors are texture with firmness having higher quality value flavour qualities such as creaminess butter taste and brine or mild fish finish and whether the caviar was taken from the fish by massage higher value rather than by killing it Caviar is generally sold in ounces An ounce of sturgeon caviar costs between  and   depending on the variety of sturgeon and other factors Industry China China has emerged as the leading producer accounting for  of the world s caviar production The largest caviar company in the world is the Chinese brand Kaluga Queen which cultivates sturgeon at Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Israel Kibbutz Dan in Israel produces four tons of caviar a year The farm is fed by the Dan River a tributary of the Jordan River Italy Sturgeon fishing in the Po river in  Italy Cristoforo da Messisbugo in his book Libro novo nel qual si insegna a far d ogni sorte di vivanda Venice  at page  gave the first recorded recipe in Italy about extraction of the eggs from the roe and caviar preparation to be consumed fresh or to preserve The writer and voyager J r me Lalande in his book Voyage en Italie Paris  vol  page  noted that many sturgeon were caught in the Po delta area in the territory of Ferrara In  a diplomatic war broke out between the Papal States governing the Ferrara territory and the Venetian Republic about sturgeon fishing rights in the Po River the border between the two states From about  and until  there was a shop in Ferrara named Nuta from the nickname of the owner Benvenuta Ascoli that processed all the sturgeons caught in the Po River for caviar extraction using an elaboration of the original Messisbugo recipe and shipped it to Italy and Europe A new owner sporadically continued production until  when the sturgeon stopped swimming up the Po River Since  some sturgeon have reappeared in the Po Currently Italian caviar is obtained almost entirely from bred sturgeons The caviar production is concentrated predominantly in Brescia which is considered the capital of Italian caviar in this area in Calvisano is located the world s largest sturgeon farm that produces annually  tonnes of caviar Italian caviar is generally the most sold and appreciated in the world Italy is the world s leading producer Madagascar Madagascar is the first African country that produces and exports caviar since  Malaysia In Malaysia caviar production is relatively new and smaller in scale Caviar is harvested from farmed sturgeon fish in Tanjung Malim Perak The caviar produced here is marketed as tropical caviar The first Malaysian brand of tropical caviar was launched in March  North America In the early th century Canada and the United States were the major caviar suppliers to Europe they harvested roe from the lake sturgeon in the North American Midwest and from the shortnose sturgeon and the Atlantic sturgeon spawning in the rivers of the East Coast of the United States The American caviar industry started when Henry Schacht a German immigrant opened a business catching sturgeon on the Delaware River He treated his caviar with German salt and exported a great deal of it to Europe Around the same time sturgeon was fished from the Columbia River on the West Coast of the United States also supplying caviar American caviar was so plentiful at the time that it was given away at bars to induce or prolong patrons thirst Today the shortnose sturgeon is rated Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of endangered species and rated Endangered per the Endangered Species Act With the depletion of Caspian and Black Sea caviar production of farmed or sustainable caviar has greatly increased In particular northern California is reported to account for  to  of U S production In  a significant illegal sturgeon egg harvesting and selling ring run in part by the former top sturgeon biologist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources DNR was discovered and broken up by investigators Russia In the wake of over fishing the harvest and sale of black caviar were banned in Russia in  The ban on sturgeon fishing in the Caspian Sea has led to the development of aquaculture as an economically viable means of commercial caviar production Spain The dam at Alcal del R o started in  blocked the upstream migration of sturgeon in the Guadalquivir The th century book Don Quixote mentions cavial in a banquet of German pilgrims Until  sturgeons and caviar were collected at the lower parts of rivers Guadalquivir Ebro Duero and Tajo From  to  the Ybarra family had a factory in Coria del R o Overfishing pollution and the Alcal del R o dam eliminated the wild population of Acipenser naccarii In Spain a fish farm called Caviar de Riofr o produces organic caviar at Loja Granada Andalusia United Kingdom The British royal family had held a long affinity with the sturgeon since  when Edward II decreed it a royal fish whereby all sturgeons found within the foreshore of the Kingdom were decreed property of the monarch Uruguay As well with Canada and the United States Uruguay has become a major producer and exporter Ecology Overfishing smuggling and pollution caused by sewage entry into the Caspian Sea have considerably reduced the sea s sturgeon population In September  the United States Fish and Wildlife Service banned the import of Caspian Sea Beluga caviar to protect the endangered Beluga sturgeon a month later the ban was extended to include Beluga caviar from the entire Black Sea basin In January  the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna CITES supported an international embargo on caviar export In January  this ban was partly lifted allowing the sale of  tons of caviar  below the official  level In July  Russia and some other CIS countries restarted the export of caviar The  quotas allow for the export of three tons of beluga  tons of sevruga and  tons of osetra In September  Kazakhstan launched a state monopoly brand Zhaik Balyk from the Kazakh word for the Ural River Under the CITES agreement Kazakhstan was granted the right to produce  of the  tons allowed up until  February  Extraction Imitation caviar of the lumpfish Commercial caviar production historically involved stunning the fish and extracting the ovaries Another method of extracting caviar is by performing a caesarean section which allows the female to continue producing roe Other farmers use a process called stripping which extracts the caviar from the fish via a small incision made along the urogenital muscle when the fish is deemed to be ready to be processed An ultrasound is used to determine the correct timing Removing the caviar by massage may yield higher quality and a more sustainable source Preparation Preparation follows a sequence that has not significantly changed over the last century First the ovaries are removed from a sedated female sturgeon and passed through a sieve to remove the membrane Freed roes are rinsed to wash away impurities Roes are now ready to become caviar by adding a precise amount of salt for taste and preservation The fresh product is tasted and graded according to quality Finally the eggs are packed into lacquer lined tins that will be further processed or sold directly to customers Substitutes Caviar substitutes In coastal British Columbia Fraser River white sturgeon are sustainably farmed to produce caviar A sturgeon caviar imitation is a black or red coloured lumpsucker caviar sold throughout Europe in small glass jars In Sweden and Finland the roes of many fish species including vendace burbot salmon and common whitefish are also commonly eaten in a similar manner as caviar However they are not caviar substitutes but are enjoyed in their own right Spherification of liquids with alginate a seaweed polysaccharide is used to recreate caviar s texture With liquids flavored to resemble caviar one obtains kosher and vegan caviar substitutes They resemble beluga caviar in appearance and are either used as a food prop for television and film or enjoyed by vegetarians and other people worldwide In Scandinavia a type of sandwich spread is available made from smoked cod roe and other ingredients which is referred to as sm rg skaviar meaning sandwich caviar Outside Scandinavia the product is referred to as creamed smoked roe or in French as Caviar de Lysekil Storage and nutrition Caviar is highly perishable and must be kept refrigerated until

companies that grows sturgeon and sells black caviar It is Russia s largest producer of black caviar History Black caviar of Russian Caviar House The farm was established in  as an experimental fish farm which belonged to Vologdarybprom and was located on the Suda River in Vologda Oblast closer to its source than industrial enterprises established along the river By  the company was in a pre bankrupt state When Alexander Novikov stepped in as the new owner in  the farm found new opportunities for success reorienting from growing carp to breeding sturgeon with a focus on black caviar In the s the sturgeon caviar market was full of illegal fishery supplies from the Caspian Sea and expected maturity of sturgeon kept in captivity before it had its first caviar eggs exceeded  years  years in the wild that is why investors refused to fund Novikov s venture Having invested about  million in   the entrepreneur reorganized the farm bought new equipment and began to grow fish using the modern aquaculture method The basis of the future broodstock was purchased at the Konakovo sturgeon plant and small adult herds were being purchased from specialized Soviet enterprises Before the fish began to spawn the farm was making money selling the fish itself It sold up to  tons of sturgeon annually which brought up to  million of revenue per year In  the first batch of produced caviar went on sale and the following year the Russian authorities banned sturgeon fishing and destroyed caviar confiscated from poachers The ban dramatically reduced the number of retail suppliers and raised the demand for caviar obtained by the aquaculture method In the following years the modern structure of Russian Caviar House group of companies was formed the retail trading company of the same name the fish company Diana and the production and sales company Belovodye which specializes in the supply of caviar to retailers Including the initial investment of  million about  million were invested in the fish farming business in   Company Production Fish cages on the river Suda Packing department Russian Caviar House fish farm is the largest in Russia and Europe In  the company s

sturgeon beluga starry sturgeon sterlet and other does not just give caviar for sale but is also used to replenish broodstock The company uses closed pools the water in which is cleaned using filters as well as live fish wells on the river Suda in which the water remains warm all year round due to clean water from the cooling system of the Cherepovets thermal power plant The fish in Russian Caviar House farm undergoes a regular physical examination including measurement weighing ultrasound and biopsy for viewing eggs A unique identifier of each fish and information about its health are recorded on a chip implanted in the area of the first spike from the head Since its first years the company has used and promoted a no kill method of harvesting caviar which is called milking Milking is carried out using aseptic technique and takes about  minutes the farm staff fix the fish with its belly upside trim its oviduct and by massaging the fish from head to tail pump the caviar After surgery the fish returns to natural conditions Over the years the company has managed to reduce the invasiveness of the procedure and reduce the mortality of fish to   This procedure can be repeated every  years and keeps the broodstock alive During the first milking the caviar volume is about  of the body weight of the fish with age it reaches  On average one fish brings  kilograms of caviar a year The traditional method of killing fish makes up about  of production and is applied only to old and poorly growing fish in order to control livestock After the farm caviar enters the production

were among important export destinations as well However in  the company could not start exporting caviar to the European Union region due to lack of regulations on the procedure and conditions for aquaculture fish farming in Russia Export accounts for    of the production output the rest of the products are sold in Russia According to statements by officials and information from the brochures

From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Regional preferences for alcoholic beverages Map of Europe with individual countries grouped by preferred type of alcoholic drink based on recorded alcohol per capita age  consumption in litres of pure alcohol in  Wine Beer Spirits Map of Europe with individual countries grouped into three regions by dominant patterns of alcohol consumption and traditionally preferred types of alcoholic drink Wine drinking countries Mediterranean pattern Beer drinking countries Central European pattern Spirit drinking countries Eastern Northern European pattern Both Denmark and Slovakia are categorized either as beer drinking countries or as spirit drinking countries Alcohol preferences in Europe vary from country to country between beer wine or spirits These preferences are traditionally associated with certain regions Hence the Central European pattern of alcohol consumption is associated with beer drinking the Mediterranean pattern with wine drinking and the Eastern or Northern European pattern with spirit drinking countries However traditional preferences do not necessarily correspond to current drinking habits as beer has become the most popular alcoholic drink world wide Countries preferring spirits The following countries known as the vodka belt are significant producers and consumers of spirits particularly vodka Sweden Norway Iceland Finland Estonia Latvia Lithuania Russia Belarus Ukraine Poland preferring beer as well Slovakia preferring beer as well The southern boundary of this region corresponds to the  C  F January isotherm in lowlands With the exception of Slovakia Poland Ukraine and some regions of southern Russia cultivation of grapes is impossible or very difficult EU countries preferring vodka produce over  of the EU s vodka Vodka preference is sometimes associated exclusively with the Slavic countries of Central and Eastern Europe as they are the historical homeland of vodka Poland and Russia being the nations most often associated with the invention of the drink Before the th century vodka was considered very much a people s drink that was common among the peasantry who made up the majority of the population in most countries of the time while the aristocracy preferred imported wines or other alcoholic drinks that were considered less plebeian There are exceptions such as ubr wka a type of Polish vodka that dates back to the th century which became popular among the szlachta nobility as well as the peasantry as early as the th century In his book about the Soviet Union Alex de Jonge elaborates on his concept of geoalcoholics In particular he explains Russian peculiarities by their belonging to the vodka belt and the absence of the beer belt in the Soviet Union Other than the prevalent hard liquor the vodka belt is also characterised by a higher occurrence of binge drinking compared to the rest of Europe Likewise in his Russia and the Russians historian Geoffrey Hoskins notes the distinct effect vodka culture has had on the countries of the former Russian Empire creating drinking as a social problem on a different level from other European countries In many countries traditionally preferring vodka it has been supplanted by beer as the alcoholic drink of choice since the early st century Residents of Finland and Sweden consume twice as much beer as vodka in terms of pure alcohol The Polish Beer Lovers Party which won  seats in the Sejm in  was founded on the notion of fighting alcoholism by a cultural abandonment of vodka for beer And indeed in  beer surpassed vodka as the most popular alcoholic drink in Poland The term has received much attention since  in the context of the vodka war within the European Union about the standardisation of vodka the vodka preferring countries insist that only spirits produced from grains and potato must be allowed to be branded as vodka according to the long established traditions of its production a brand protection similar to the protected designation of origin The Schnellhardt compromise proposed by Horst Schnellhardt suggests that vodkas from other than cereals potatoes and molasses should be labeled to say Vodka produced from Countries preferring beer Countries in Europe in which beer is historically the most popular alcoholic drink informally known as the beer belt are located to the southwest of countries preferring vodka vodka belt and to the northeast of the countries preferring wine wine belt These countries geography is closely tied to the historical growing range of its two main ingredients barley and hops Barley was first domesticated during the Neolithic in the ancient Near East It has been brewed into beer like beverages for thousands of years and grown in most of Europe since ancient times Hops are more narrowly distributed preferring humid temperate climates similar to potatoes Originally European ale not yet called beer in Germanic languages was produced without hops which were introduced to Europe from the east The first evidence of hops in Europe dates from  CE in the Hallertau region of present day Germany although the first mention of the use of hops in brewing in that country was not until  The westward spread of hops was slow not reaching England until  Ireland was still importing hops in the eighteenth century more than  tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone in  In  the Bavarian Reinheitsgebot Purity Law established that barley hops and water were the only allowable ingredients in beer yeast was considered a by product rather than an ingredient This became the template for beers across Europe While non barley beers e g wheat beer and non hopped beers e g flavoured with gruit are still produced across most of Europe beer is synonymous with barley and hops Since the northern range of hops does not include most of Scandinavia or Russia or much of Scotland these areas for the most part are outside of the beer belt and lie in the vodka whisky belt As of  the beer preferring countries include Belgium Ireland the United Kingdom the Netherlands Denmark Germany some parts of Austria Luxembourg Czech Republic Slovakia Poland Slovenia Central Federal District of Russia the northern and eastern German speaking cantons of Switzerland and the French regions of Alsace Lorraine Nord Pas de Calais and the department of Ardennes There is quite a bit of overlap in these French regions as well as in southwestern Germany Luxembourg and most parts of Austria due to the considerable consumption and cultivation of fine wine there and Poland is also a part of the vodka belt In  UNESCO inscribed Belgian beer culture on their list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity Countries preferring wine Countries in Europe in which wine is historically the most popular alcoholic drink informally known as the wine belt are located to the south of beer belt and vodka belt The wine belt has been variously defined as approximately spanning   N   N and    N Countries in the wine belt include Spain Portugal Italy Greece Georgia Cyprus Albania Kosovo North Macedonia Serbia Montenegro Croatia Bulgaria San Marino Switzerland Romania France and Southern Federal District of Russia The countries of Austria Hungary and Slovenia which themselves produce some highly regarded wines may sometimes be considered as part of the wine belt but they overlap largely and are in line more with the Beer Belt instead Additionally Southwest England if one classes cider as a wine analogue parts of the Low Countries southwestern Germany and parts of Austria could be considered to lie either within the belt or within an overlap region A number of countries in Southeast Europe that fall within the wine belt also produce a variety of fruit brandies many of which are considered their national drink such as uic Rakia and P linka The UNESCO has declared some wine regions in its World Heritage Sites France Champagne hillsides houses and cellars Hungary Tokaj wine region Italy Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont Langhe Roero and Monferrato the traditional agricultural practice of cultivating the vite ad alberello head

Prohibition is the act or practice of forbidding something by law more particularly the term refers to the banning of the manufacture storage whether in barrels or in bottles transportation sale possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages The word is also used to refer to a period of time during which such bans are enforced History The Drunkard s Progress A lithograph by Nathaniel Currier supporting the temperance movement January  Some kind of limitation on the trade in alcohol can be seen in the Code of Hammurabi c  BCE specifically banning the selling of beer for money It could only be bartered for barley If a beer seller do not receive barley as the price for beer but if she receive money or make the beer a measure smaller than the barley measure received they shall throw her into the water In the early twentieth century much of the impetus for the prohibition movement in the Nordic countries and North America came from moralistic convictions of pietistic Protestants Prohibition movements in the West coincided with the advent of women s suffrage with newly empowered women as part of the political process strongly supporting policies that curbed alcohol consumption The first half of the th century saw periods of prohibition of alcoholic beverages in several countries  to  Prohibition in Canada nationally as well as in most provinces including  to  in

States crossed the Detroit Windsor border Prohibition generally came to an end in the late s or early s in most of North America and Europe although a few locations continued prohibition for many more years In some countries where the dominant religion forbids the use of alcohol the production sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited or restricted today For example in Saudi Arabia and Libya alcohol is banned in Pakistan and Iran it is illegal with exceptions Effects Generally prohibition is not completely effective and tends to drive the market underground instead Most countries which have maintained long standing alcohol bans have predominantly Muslim populations whose religious beliefs forbid them from drinking but the broad popularity of alcohol has meant prohibition is extremely difficult to enforce in most nations The vast majority of countries which have at one point fully prohibited alcohol have since reversed it Both the United States and Soviet Union implemented total bans on alcohol only to repeal them after less than  years Prohibition worldwide Africa Nigeria In the British colony of Nigeria missionary forces demanded prohibition of liquor which proved highly unpopular Both Africans and British found illegal supplies such as secret stills obtaining colonial liquor permits and smuggling The experiment began in  and was repealed in  South Africa During the coronavirus outbreak of  alcohol sales and even the transportation of alcohol outside of one s home was made illegal This order came into effect during the nationwide lockdown on  March  The purpose of the ban was intended to prevent drunken fights reduce domestic violence stop drunk driving and eliminate the weekend binge drinking so prevalent across South Africa Police medics and analysts estimate conservatively that alcohol is involved in or responsible for at least  of all emergency hospital admissions By reducing the number of people within hospitals and of course within social gatherings the goal of prohibition was to reduce the rate of transmission and thus slow the spread of the virus A  study found that the alcohol prohibition reduced injury induced mortality by at least  a conservative estimate and sharply reduced violent crime South Asia Afghanistan Sale of alcohol is banned in Afghanistan Bangladesh In Bangladesh alcohol is somewhat prohibited

Revolution of  and the Russian Civil War into the period of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union until  United Kingdom Although the sale or consumption of commercial alcohol has never been prohibited by law in the United Kingdom various groups in the UK have campaigned for the prohibition of alcohol including the Society of Friends Quakers The Methodist Church and other non conformists as well as temperance movements such as Band of Hope and temperance Chartist movements of the nineteenth century Formed in  and inspired by the Maine law in the United States the United Kingdom Alliance aimed at promoting a similar law prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the UK This hard line group of prohibitionists was opposed by other temperance organisations who preferred moral persuasion to a legal ban

Scrymgeour served as Member of Parliament for Dundee between  November  and  October  He remains the only person to have ever been elected to the House of Commons on a prohibitionist ticket In  he defeated incumbent Liberal member Winston Churchill winning the seat for the Scottish Prohibition Party which he had founded in  and for which he had stood for election successfully as a Dundee Burgh Councillor in  and unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate between  and  North America Canada Main article Prohibition in Canada Indigenous peoples in Canada were subject to prohibitory alcohol laws under the Indian Act of  Sections of the Indian Act regarding liquor were not repealed for over a hundred years until  An official but non binding federal referendum on prohibition was held in  Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier s government chose not to introduce a federal bill on prohibition mindful of the strong antipathy in Quebec As a result Canadian prohibition was instead enacted through laws passed by the provinces during the first twenty years of the th century especially during the s Canada did however enact a national prohibition from  to  as a temporary wartime measure Much of the rum running during prohibition took place in Windsor Ontario The provinces later repealed their prohibition laws mostly during the s although some local municipalities remain dry Mexico Some communities in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas of are under the control of the libertarian socialist Zapatista Army of National Liberation and often ban alcohol as part of what was described as a collective decision This prohibition has been used by many villages as a way to decrease domestic violence and has generally been favored by women This prohibition however is not recognized by federal Mexican law as the Zapatista movement is strongly opposed by the federal government The sale and purchase of alcohol is prohibited on and the night before certain national holidays such as Natalicio de Benito Ju rez birthdate of Benito Ju rez and D a de la Revoluci n which are meant to be dry nationally The same dry law applies to the days before presidential elections every six years United States Main article Prohibition in the United States This  illustration from the Hawaiian Gazette shows the Anti Saloon League and the Woman s Christian Temperance Union s campaign against beer brewers The water cure was a form of torture that was in the news because of its use in the Philippines Prohibition in the United States focused on the manufacture transportation and sale of alcoholic beverages exceptions were made for medicinal and religious uses Alcohol consumption was never illegal under federal law Nationwide Prohibition did not begin in the United States until January  when the Eighteenth Amendment to the U S Constitution went into effect The th amendment was ratified in  and was repealed in December  with the ratification of the Twenty first Amendment Concern over excessive alcohol consumption began during the American colonial era when fines were imposed for drunken behavior and for selling liquor without a license In the mid th century evangelical Protestants denounced drinking as sinful and demanded the prohibition of the sale of beer wine and liquor Apart from Maine they had limited success until the early th century By the s the temperance movement was actively encouraging individuals to immediately stop drinking However the issue of slavery and then the Civil War overshadowed the temperance movement until the s Prohibition was a major reform movement from the s until the s when nationwide prohibition went into effect It was supported by evangelical Protestant churches especially the Methodists Baptists Presbyterians Disciples of Christ Congregationalists Quakers and Scandinavian Lutherans Opposition came from Catholics Episcopalians and German Lutherans The Women s Crusade of  and the Woman s Christian Temperance Union WCTU founded in  were means through which certain women organized and demanded political action well before they were granted the vote The WCTU and the Prohibition Party were major players until the th century when the Anti Saloon League emerged as the movement s leader By   states had statewide prohibition and  others had local option laws in effect The League then turned their efforts toward attaining a constitutional amendment and grassroots support for nationwide prohibition The German American community was the base of the beer industry and became a pariah when the U S declared war on Germany in  A new constitutional amendment passed Congress in December  and was ratified by the states in  It prohibited the manufacture sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within the importation thereof into or the exportation thereof On October   Congress passed the National Prohibition Act known as the Volstead Act to implement the new th Amendment After a year s required delay national prohibition began on January   Prescription form for medicinal liquor Initially alcohol consumption nosedived to about  of its pre Prohibition levels but within a few years the illicit market grew to roughly two thirds Illegal stills flourished in remote rural areas as well as city slums and large quantities were smuggled from Canada Bootlegging became a major business activity for organized crime groups under leaders such as Al Capone in Chicago and Lucky Luciano in New York City Prohibition lost support during the Great Depression from  The repeal movement was initiated and financed by the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment and Pauline Sabin a wealthy Republican founded the Women s Organization for National Prohibition Reform WONPR Repeal of Prohibition in the United States was accomplished with the ratification of the Twenty first Amendment on December   Under its terms states were allowed to set their own laws for the control of alcohol Between  and  federal legislation prohibited the sale of alcohol to Native Americans with very limited success After  Native American communities and reservations were permitted to pass their own local ordinances governing the sale of alcoholic beverages In the st century there are still counties and parishes within the United States known as dry where the sale of alcohol is prohibited or restricted South America Venezuela In Venezuela twenty four hours before every election the government prohibits the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages throughout the national territory including the restriction to all dealers liquor stores supermarkets restaurants wineries pubs bars public entertainment clubs and any establishment that markets alcoholic beverages The same is done during Holy Week as a measure to reduce the alarming rate of road traffic accidents during these holidays Oceania Australia The first consignment of liquor in Canberra Australian Capital Territory following the repeal of prohibition laws in  The Australian Capital Territory then the Federal Capital Territory was the first jurisdiction in Australia to have prohibition laws In  King O Malley then Minister of Home Affairs shepherded laws through Parliament preventing new issue or transfer of licences to sell alcohol to address unruly behaviour among workers building the new capital city Prohibition was partial since possession of alcohol purchased outside of the Territory remained legal and the few pubs that had existing licences could continue to operate The Federal Parliament repealed the laws after residents of the Federal Capital Territory voted for the end of them in a  plebiscite Since then some state governments and local councils have enacted dry areas This is where the purchase or consumption of alcohol is only permitted in licensed areas such as liquor stores clubs cafes bars hotels restaurants and also private homes In public places such as streets parks and squares consumption is not permitted but carrying bottles that were purchased at licensed venues is allowed Almost all dry areas are small defined districts within larger urban or rural communities More recently alcohol has been prohibited in many remote Indigenous communities Penalties for transporting alcohol into these dry communities are severe and can result in confiscation of any vehicles involved in dry areas within the Northern Territory all vehicles used to transport alcohol are seized New Zealand In New Zealand prohibition was a moralistic reform movement begun in the mid s by the Protestant evangelical and Nonconformist churches and the Woman s Christian Temperance Union and after  by the Prohibition League It assumed that individual virtue was all that was needed to carry the colony forward from a pioneering society to a more mature one but it never achieved its goal of national prohibition Both the Church of England and the largely Irish Catholic Church rejected prohibition as an intrusion of government into the church s domain while the growing labor movement saw capitalism rather than alcohol as the enemy Reformers hoped that the women s vote in which New Zealand was a pioneer would swing the balance but the women were not as well organized as in other countries Prohibition had a majority in a national referendum in  but needed a  vote to pass The movement kept trying in the s losing three more referendums by close votes it managed to keep in place a  pm closing hour for pubs and Sunday closing The Depression and war years effectively ended the movement but their  p m closing hour remained until October  when it was extended to  pm For many years referendums were held for individual towns or electorates often coincident with general elections The ballots determined whether these individual areas would be dry that is alcohol could not be purchased or consumed in public in these areas One notable example was the southern city of Invercargill which was dry from  to  People wanting alcohol usually travelled to places outside the city such as the nearby township of Lorneville or the town of Winton to drink in the local pubs or purchase alcohol to take back home The last bastion of this dry area remains in force in the form of a licensing trust that still to this day governs the sale of liquor in Invercargill The city does not allow the sale of alcohol beer and wine included in supermarkets unlike in the majority of New Zealand and all form of alcohol regardless of the sort can only be sold in bars and liquor stores Prohibition was of limited success in New Zealand as like in other countries it led to organised bootlegging The most famous bootlegged alcohol in New Zealand was that produced in the Hokonui Hills close to the town of Gore not coincidentally the nearest large town to Invercargill Even today the term Hokonui conjures up images of illicit whisky to many New Zealanders Elections In many countries in Latin America the Philippines Thailand Turkey India and several US states the sale but not the consumption of alcohol is prohibited before and during elections See also Liquor portalHistory portal

served freezer chilled in the vodka belt of Belarus Estonia Finland Iceland Latvia Lithuania Norway Poland Russia Sweden and Ukraine It is also used in cocktails and mixed drinks such as the vodka martini Cosmopolitan vodka tonic screwdriver greyhound Black or White Russian Moscow mule Bloody Mary and Caesar Etymology The name vodka is a diminutive form of the Slavic word voda water interpreted as waterkin root vod k diminutive suffix among other functions a ending of feminine gender In English literature the word vodka appeared in around the late th century In a book of travels published in English in  presumably a translation from German Johann Gottlieb Georgi correctly explained that kabak in the Russian language signifies a public house for the common people to drink vodka a sort of brandy in William Tooke in  glossed vodka as rectified corn spirits using the traditional English sense of the word corn to refer to any grain not just maize In French Th ophile Gautier in  glossed it as a grain liquor served with meals in Poland eau de vie de grain Another possible connection of vodka with water is the name of the medieval alcoholic beverage aqua vitae Latin literally water of life which is reflected in Polish okowita Ukrainian Belarusian and Scandinavian akvavit Whiskey has a similar etymology from the Irish and Scottish Gaelic uisce beatha uisge beatha People in the area of vodka s probable origin have names for vodka with roots meaning to burn Polish gorza a Ukrainian romanized hor lka Belarusian romanized harelka Lithuanian degtin Samogitian degt n is also in use colloquially and in proverbs Latvian degv ns Finnish paloviina In Russian during the th and th centuries or goryashchee vino burning wine or hot wine was widely used Others languages include the German Branntwein Danish br ndevin Dutch brandewijn Swedish br nnvin and Norwegian brennevin although the latter terms refer to any strong alcoholic beverage History The vodka belt countries of Northern Central and Eastern Europe are the historic home of vodka These countries have the highest vodka consumption in the world Scholars debate the beginnings of vodka because there is little historical material available For many centuries beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today as the spirit at that time had a different flavor color and smell and was originally used as medicine It contained little alcohol an estimated maximum of about  Distillation techniques were developed in Roman Egypt by the rd century but the description of aqua ardens burning water i e alcohol made by distilling wine with salt appears in Latin works only by the th century The process was well known among European medieval chemists by about  Poland The world s first written mention of the word w dka was in  from Akta Grodzkie recorder of deeds in the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland At the time the word w dka referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetics cleansers The production of liquor begins in the mid th century with varied local traditions emerging throughout Europe in Poland as vodka Polish w dka or gorza ka In the th century the Polish word for the beverage was gorza ka from the Old Polish verb gorze meaning to burn which is also the source of Ukrainian horilka The word written in Cyrillic appeared first in  about a medicinal drink brought from Poland to Russia by the Russian merchants In these early days the spirits were used mostly as medicines Stefan Falimierz asserted in his  works on herbs that vodka could serve to increase fertility and awaken lust Wodka lub gorza ka  by Jerzy Pota ski contains valuable information on the production of vodka Jakub Kazimierz Haur in his book Sk ad albo skarbiec znakomitych sekret w ekonomii ziemia skiej A Treasury of Excellent Secrets about Landed Gentry s Economy Krak w  gave detailed recipes for making vodka from rye Chopin Wyborowa ubr wka Luksusowa Some Polish vodka blends go back centuries Most notable are ubr wka from about the th century Goldwasser from the early th century and aged Starka vodka from the th century In the mid th century the szlachta nobility of Poland were granted a monopoly on producing and selling vodka in their territories This privilege was a source of substantial profits One of the most famous distilleries of the aristocracy was established by El bieta Izabela Lubomirska and later operated by her grandson Alfred Wojciech Potocki The Vodka Industry Museum located at the park of the Potocki country estate has an original document attesting that the distillery already existed in  Today it operates as Polmos a cut Vodka production on a much larger scale began in Poland at the end of the th century initially at Krak w whence spirits were exported to Silesia before  Silesian cities also bought vodka from Pozna a city that in  had  working spirits distilleries Soon however Gda sk outpaced both these cities In the th and th centuries Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands Denmark England Russia Germany Austria Hungary Romania Ukraine Bulgaria and the Black Sea basin Early production methods were rudimentary The beverage was usually low proof and the distillation process had to be repeated several times a three stage distillation process was common The first distillate was called brant wka the second was szum wka and the third was okowita from aqua vitae which generally contained   ABV Then the beverage was watered down yielding a simple vodka   ABV or a stronger one if the watering was done using an alembic The exact production methods were described in  by Jan Pawe Biretowski and in  by Jan Chryzostom Pasek The late th century inaugurated the production of vodka from various unusual substances including even the carrot Though there was a substantial vodka cottage industry in Poland back to the th century the end of the th century marked the start of real industrial production of vodka in Poland Kresy the eastern part of Poland was controlled by the Russian empire at that time Vodkas produced by the nobility and clergy became a mass product The first industrial distillery was opened in  in Lw w by J A Baczewski He was soon followed by Jakub Haberfeld who in  established a factory at O wi cim and by Hartwig Kantorowicz who started producing Wyborowa in  at Pozna The implementation of new technologies in the latter half of the th century which allowed the production of clear vodkas contributed to their success The first rectification distillery was established in  In  the production of clear vodkas was made a Polish government monopoly After World War II all vodka distilleries were taken over by Poland s Marxist Leninist government During the martial law of the s the sale of vodka was rationed Following the success of the Solidarity movement and the abolition of single party rule in Poland many distilleries began struggling financially Some filed for bankruptcy but many were privatized leading to the creation of various new brands Russia Russian Vodka in various bottles and cups Russian Empire A type of distilled liquor designated by the Russian word vodka came to Russia in the late th century In  the Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae water of life to Moscow and presented it to Dmitry Donskoy the grand prince The liquid obtained by distillation of grape must was thought to be a concentrate and a spirit of wine spiritus vini in Latin whence came to the name of this substance in many European languages like English spirit or Russian spirt Perhaps one of the earliest terms linked to vodka production was varenoe vino distilled wine which appears in a  document Another term used was perevara a precursor to vodka which last appears in official documents in  The term korchma is one of the oldest official terms used for vodka which was used alongside varenoe vino but later came to denote illegally produced vodka by the th century Other terms that referred to vodka included goriachee vino burning wine zhzhenoe vino burnt wine and khlebnoe vino bread wine According to William Pokhlyobkin in around  a monk named Isidore from the Chudov Monastery inside the Moscow Kremlin made a recipe of the first Russian vodka Having a special knowledge and distillation devices he became the creator of a new higher quality type of alcoholic beverage This bread wine as it was initially known was for a long time produced exclusively in the Moscow grand principality and in no other Russian principality this situation persisted until the era of industrial production Thus this beverage was closely associated with Moscow In  Ivan III created the first Russian state monopoly on vodka In  the first exports of distilled Russian vodka arrived in Sweden By the th century government run taverns known as kabaks replaced privately run korchmas Giles Fletcher who was the English ambassador in Russia wrote In every great towne of his Realme he hath a Caback or drinking house where is sold aquavit which they call Russewine mead beere c Out of these hee receiveth rent that amounteth to a great summe of money Of the Russe Common Wealth  Until the mid th century the drink remained relatively low in alcohol content not exceeding  ABV Multiple terms for the drink were recorded sometimes reflecting different levels of quality alcohol concentration filtering and the number of distillations most commonly it was referred to as burning wine bread wine or even in some locations simply wine In some locations grape wine may have been so expensive that it was a drink only for aristocrats Burning wine was usually diluted with water to  ABV or less before drinking It was mostly sold in taverns and was quite expensive At the same time the word vodka was already in use but it described herbal tinctures similar to Nalewka containing up to  ABV and made for medicinal purposes A Vodka museum in Russia located in Verkhniye Mandrogi Leningrad Oblast The first written usage of the word vodka in an official Russian document in its modern meaning is dated by the decree of Empress Elizabeth of  June  which regulated the ownership of vodka distilleries By the s a government policy of promoting the consumption of state manufactured vodka made it the drink of choice for many Russians In  the government monopoly on vodka production was repealed causing prices to plummet and making vodka available even to low income citizens The taxes on vodka became a key element of government finances in Tsarist Russia providing at times up to  of state revenue By  vodka comprised  of all alcohol consumed in Russia This level has fluctuated somewhat during the th century but remained quite high at all times The most recent estimates put it at   Post Soviet Russia Vodka remains a major source of state revenue and therefore of power Seizing control of the state spirits monopoly Rosspirtprom and its Kristall distillery was instrumental for Vladimir Putin to consolidate his power as prime minister and president Under his rule the Putinka little Putin brand of vodka became a bestseller partly to Putin s financial benefit Other popular Russian vodka producers or brands include Stolichnaya and Russian Standard William Pokhlebin s A History of Vodka During the late s Russian culinary author William Pokhlebkin compiled a history of the production of vodka in Russia as part of the Soviet case in a trade dispute this was later published as A History of Vodka Pokhlebkin wrote that while there is a wealth of publications about the history of consumption and distribution of vodka virtually nothing had been written about vodka production One of his assertions was that the word vodka was used in popular speech in Russia considerably earlier than the middle of the th century but the word did not appear in print until the s Pokhlebkin s sources were challenged by David Christian in the Slavic Review in  who criticized the lack of valid references in Pokhlebkin s works and its pro Russian bias Pokhlebkin is also known for his Pan Slavic sympathies under the leadership of Russia and sentiments that in David Christian s opinion discredit most of his work especially his History of Vodka Sweden Up until the s vodka was not used as a designation for Swedish distilled beverages which were instead called br nnvin burn wine the word having the same etymology as the Dutch Brandewijn which is the base for the word brandy This beverage has been produced in Sweden since the late th century although the total production was still small in the th century From the early th century production expanded although production was prohibited several times during grain shortages Although initially a grain product potatoes started to be used in the production in the late th century and became dominant from the early th century From the early s distillery equipment was improved Progressively from the s unflavoured Swedish br nnvin also came to be called vodka The first Swedish product to use this term was Explorer Vodka which was created in  and initially was intended for the American export market Although it ultimately failed to do so it remains one of the most popular vodka brands in Sweden today In  Absolut Vodka was launched reusing the name of the old Absolut Rent Br nnvin absolutely pure br nnvin created in  After Sweden joined the European Union in  the regulations were changed so that privately owned companies could produce Vodka Vodka has become

is produced from grains such as sorghum corn rye or wheat Among grain vodkas rye and wheat vodkas are generally considered superior Some vodkas are made from potatoes molasses soybeans grapes rice sugar beets and sometimes even byproducts of oil refining or wood pulp processing In some Central European countries such as Poland some vodka is produced by just fermenting a solution of crystal sugar and yeast In the European Union there are talks about the standardization of vodka and the Vodka Belt countries insist that only spirits produced from grains potato and sugar beet molasses be allowed to be branded as vodka following the traditional methods of production In the United States many vodkas are made from  pure grain alcohol produced in large quantities by agricultural industrial giants Archer Daniels Midland Grain Processing Corporation and Midwest Grain Products MGP Bottlers purchase the base spirits in bulk then filter dilute distribute and market the end product under a variety of vodka brand names Similar methods are used in other regions such as Europe This pure grain alcohol also known as rectified spirit neutral spirit or ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin is also available directly to consumers in some areas as products such as Everclear Polmos spirytus rektyfikowany and others In contrast to very high ABV vodkas such as the Bulgarian Balkan  with  ABV these grain alcohol products are not considered vodka they have not yet gone through the filtration and refining process used to produce vodka A study conducted on NPR s Planet Money podcast revealed negligible differences in taste between various brands of vodka leading to speculation as to how much branding contributes to the concept of super premium vodkas Distilling and filtering This section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed August  Learn how and when to remove this template message A common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration before any additional processing including the addition of flavorants Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation as well as afterward where the distilled vodka is filtered through activated charcoal and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off flavors to the vodka However this is not the case in the traditional vodka producing nations so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering thus preserving the unique flavors and characteristics of their products The master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration which includes the removal of the fore shots heads and tails These components of the distillate contain flavor compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate heads as well as the fusel oils tails that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka Through numerous rounds of distillation or the use of a fractioning still the taste is modified and clarity is increased In contrast the distillery process for liquors such as whiskey rum and baijiu allow portions of the heads and tails to remain giving them their unique flavors Repeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users whether legislation determines strength limits or not Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the still master the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as   ethanol As such most vodka is diluted with water before bottling Flavoring Main article Flavored liquor A vodka distillery in Bialystok Poland where the bison grass vodka ubr wka is produced Finnish grown six row barley and glacial spring water Finlandia Vodka While most vodkas are unflavored many flavored vodkas have been produced in traditional vodka drinking areas often as home made recipes to improve vodka s taste or for medicinal purposes Flavorings include red pepper ginger fruit flavors vanilla chocolate without sweetener and cinnamon In Russia vodka flavored with honey and pepper pertsovka in Russian is also very popular In Poland and Belarus the leaves of the local bison grass are added to produce ubr wka Polish and zubrovka Belarusian vodka with slightly sweet flavors and light amber colors In Lithuania and Poland a famous vodka containing honey is called krupnik This tradition of flavoring is also prevalent in the Nordic countries where vodka seasoned with herbs fruits and spices is the appropriate strong drink for several seasonal festivities Sweden has forty odd common varieties of herb flavored vodka kryddat br nnvin In Poland and Ukraine a separate category nalyvka in Ukraine and nalewka in Poland is used for vodka based spirits with fruit root flower or herb extracts which are often home made or produced by small commercial distilleries Their alcohol contents vary between  and  In Estonia vodkas are available with barberry blackcurrant cherry green apple lemon vanilla and watermelon flavors In most cases vodka flavoring comes from a post distillation infusion of flavors Through the fermentation process grain mash is transformed into a neutral alcohol beverage that is unflavored The process of flavoring vodka so that it tastes like fruits chocolate and other foods occurs after fermentation and distillation Various chemicals that reproduce the flavor profiles of foods are added into vodka to give it a specific taste Today Vodka is less likely than other spirits to produce the undesirable after effects of heavy consumption though no less likely to intoxicate because of its low level of fusel oils and congeners which are impurities that flavor spirits Since the year  because of evolving consumer tastes and regulatory changes several artisanal vodka or even ultra premium vodka brands have appeared European Union regulation The success of grape based vodka in the United States in the early twenty first century prompted traditional vodka producers in the Vodka Belt countries of Poland Finland Estonia Lithuania and Sweden to campaign for EU legislation that would define vodka as only spirits made from grain or potatoes This proposition provoked heavy criticism from South European countries which often distill used mash from wine making into spirits although higher quality mash is usually distilled into some variety of pomace brandy the lower quality mash is better turned into neutral flavored spirits instead Any vodka not made from either grain or potatoes would have to display the products used in its production This regulation entered into force in  Canadian regulations Under Canadian regulations Vodka is a potable alcoholic distillate obtained from potatoes cereal grain or any other material of agricultural origin fermented by the action of yeast or a mixture of yeast and other micro organisms United States regulations In  it was put into revenue ruling that sugar not more than   and trace amounts of citric acid are not considered flavoring agent The meaning of trace amounts of citric acid was clarified as not more than  ppm in  It is no longer defined as to be without distinctive character aroma taste or color The law includes other requirements Vodka cannot be aged in wood it may or may not be charcoal filtered and it must meet minimum distillation and bottling proofs Boycotts The examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with North America

American liquor stores and bars expressed symbolic solidarity with Ukraine and opposition to Russia by boycotting Russian vodka brands One critic argued that boycotts of Russian branded vodka may inadvertently affect U S vodka manufacturers and noted that only   percent of U S vodka imports come from Russia Illegal production In some countries black market or bathtub vodka is widespread because it can be produced easily and avoids taxation However severe poisoning blindness or death can occur as a result of dangerous industrial ethanol substitutes being added by black market

to the European countries In  Wyborowa became the first vodka brand to be an international trademark In the s and s Wyborowa conquered all major European countries it constituted over  of the total volume of vodka exported to the United Kingdom After the period of economic transition in the late s and early s the Pozna distillery like many others in the country got itself into serious trouble

received the International High Quality Trophy at Monde Selection s World Quality Selections in  In  Wyborowa introduced new series of products including Wyborowa od Mistrza and Dark first black vodka Production process Wyborowa is produced from rye grain using a double step distillation process The rye is sent to small privately owned agricultural distilleries where the rye is mashed and distilled once to produce raw spirit When the rye arrives at the agricultural distillery it is ground and then cooked within a large vessel using heated water from the distillery s own source The mixture is treated with enzymes that facilitate the hydrolysis of starch to glucose Afterwards it undergoes fermentation in stainless steel tanks Once the fermentation has been completed the resulting liquid is known as the wash and has an alcoholic strength of between  and  ABV The wash is distilled in a copper column still yielding a spirit around  ABV It takes  kg of rye to produce one litre of spirit This raw spirit is then transferred to the rectification plant for further purification The raw spirit passes through three columns of a continuous still to remove impurities Before Wyborowa is bottled the rectified spirit needs to be reduced to the bottling strength of  ABV by diluting it with water from a dedicated spring Once diluted the vodka is passed through natural cellulose plates and mesh filters to remove particulate matter Filtered vodka is pumped to the bottling line where   bottles of Wyborowa are filled per hour Trivia The unique bottle shape was designed by architect

had been abusing a dominant market position contrary to Article  of the EEC Treaty in particular by imposing unfair conditions on its customers by refusing to supply certain customers and by charging dissimilar prices for equivalent transactions In  the commission s decision was upheld by the European Court of Justice Cincinnati Enquirer charges On  May  The Cincinnati Enquirer published an eighteen page section Chiquita Secrets Revealed by investigative reporters Michael Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter The section accused the company of mistreating workers on its Central American plantations polluting the environment allowing cocaine to be brought to Borneo on its ships bribing foreign officials evading foreign nations laws on land ownership forcibly preventing its workers from unionizing and a host of other misdeeds Chiquita denied all the allegations and sued after it was revealed that Gallagher had repeatedly hacked into Chiquita s voicemail system A special prosecutor was appointed to investigate because the elected prosecutor at the time had ties to Carl Lindner Jr Gallagher had claimed to have obtained over   voicemails from a Chiquita executive but in truth he had obtained them by hacking into Chiquita s voicemail system as often as  times a day He had continued hacking into the system despite being explicitly directed not to do so by editors and lawyers According to McWhirter he also refused to give straight answers about his source to editors and outside lawyers facts that aroused the suspicions of McWhirter and other reporters Six weeks after the stories ran Gannett reached a settlement with Chiquita averting a lawsuit Under the terms of the settlement on  June  the Enquirer retracted the entire series of stories and published a front page apology saying it had become convinced that accusations and conclusions are untrue and created a false and misleading impression of Chiquita s business practices The Enquirer also agreed to pay a multi million dollar settlement The exact amount was not disclosed but Chiquita s annual report mentions a cash settlement in excess of  million Gallagher was fired and prosecuted and the paper s editor Lawrence K Beaupre was transferred to the Gannett s headquarters amid allegations that he ignored the paper s usual procedures on fact checking In an article examining the Chiquita series

terrorist groups See also Colombian armed conflict and Doe v Chiquita Brands InternationalOne of several documents obtained by the National Security Archive related to Chiquita s payments to terrorist groups in Colombia In the s and early s faced with an unstable political situation in Colombia Chiquita and several other corporations including the Dole Food Company Fresh Del Monte Produce and Hyundai Motor Corporation made payments to paramilitary organizations in the country most notably the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia AUC Chiquita paid the AUC   million in a ten year period Although official accounts from the company state they only made these payments as the AUC was extorting payments from Chiquita in order to ensure their security these claims are disputed as Chiquita also allowed AUC to use their loading facilities to transport AK s Indeed the Chiquita s United States counsel had warned them against using this extortion defense in cases where the company benefitted from these payments and the company s lawyer reportedly told them to stop making the payments Chiquita s dealings with AUC continued even after it was officially designated as a terrorist organization in the United States Although the company eventually voluntarily disclosed their involvement with AUC to the United States Department of Justice they still sent over   to the organization even after the Justice Department instructed them to halt all payments On  March  Chiquita Brands was fined  million as part of a settlement with the United States Justice Department for having ties to Colombian paramilitary groups According to court documents between  and  officers of a Chiquita subsidiary paid approximately   million to the right wing United Self Defense Forces of Colombia AUC

Liberation Army ELN from  to  both left wing organizations All three of these groups are on the U S State Department s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations Chiquita sued to prevent the United States government from releasing files about their illegal payments to Colombian left wing guerrillas and right wing paramilitary groups On  December  the th Specialized District Attorney s Office in Medell n Colombia subpoenaed the Chiquita board to answer questions concerning charges for conspiracy to commit an aggravated crime and financing illegal armed groups Nine board members named in the subpoena allegedly personally knew of the illegal operations One executive for the company penned a note which proclaimed that the payments were the cost of doing business in Colombia and also noted the need to keep this very confidential people can get killed In  and  Chiquita spent   lobbying against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act hiring lobbyists from Covington and Burling a high powered white shoe law firm On  July  a US appeals court threw out a lawsuit against Chiquita by   Colombians alleging that the corporation was aiding the right wing paramilitary group responsible for the deaths of family members The court ruled   that US federal courts have no jurisdiction over Colombian claims In  Judge Kenneth Marra of the Southern District of Florida ruled in favor of allowing Colombians to sue former Chiquita Brand International executives for the company s funding of the outlawed right wing paramilitary organization that murdered their family members He stated in his decision that profits took priority over basic human welfare in the banana company executives decision to finance the illegal death squads despite knowing that this would advance the paramilitaries murderous campaign In February  an agreement between Chiquita and the families of the victims had been reached Information about who was behind the Chiquita payments to terrorist groups was made available by the National Security Archive a nongovernmental research organization in a series of document releases related to Chiquita s operations In  Colombia s Office of the Attorney General filed charges against  Chiquita Brands International executives and administrators after tracing payments made by a local Chiquita affiliate to the paramilitary group AUC some of which was

governmental organization NGO Peuples Solidaires fr publicly accused the Compa ia Bananera Atl ntica Limitada COBAL a Chiquita subsidiary of knowingly violating its workers basic rights and endangering their families health and their own According to the charge the banana firm carelessly exposed laborers at the Coyol plantation in Costa Rica to highly toxic pesticides on multiple occasions Additionally COBAL was accused of using a private militia to intimidate workers Finally Peuples Solidaires claimed that Chiquita ignored some union complaints for more than a year Another more recent case of exploitative working conditions dates from April  The Swiss magazine Beobachter publicised severe labour rights issues on Ecuador s banana plantations some of which supply Chiquita These violations involve  hour workdays poverty wages and employment without contracts Environmental issues In  a coalition of social activist groups led by the European Banana Action Network EUROBAN targeted the banana industry in general and Chiquita in particular aiming to create a new climate of corporate social responsibility Their strategy was to encourage small farming of bananas rather than large scale monoculture and to push for subsidies and other government relief to level the field for small producers The fair trade movement which sought to influence consumers to purchase the products of smallholders also joined in the action Chiquita responded to the activism with changes in corporate management and new patterns of global competition according to J Gary Taylor and Patricia Scharlin Chiquita partnered with the Rainforest Alliance an environmental group dedicated to preserving the rainforest and made major reforms in the way they plant and protect their bananas The changes focused on the use of pesticides but also affected corporate culture In  Chiquita adopted a new code of conduct that included Social Accountability International s SA labor standard Also

the pesticides sprayed is Paraquat a highly hazardous pesticide forbidden in Switzerland and the EU When approached for comment Chiquita would neither confirm nor deny the allegations but reportedly began an internal investigation the results of which have not been made public In popular culture Gabriel Garc a M rquez alludes to the event in his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude by describing a military suppression that resulted in the death of   plantation workers in the fictional town of Macondo While Garc a M rquez has stated that the deaths in his novel are potential overestimations the

International Entrance fa ade of the old United Fruit Building at  St Charles Avenue New Orleans Louisiana The United Fruit Company now Chiquita was an American multinational corporation that traded in tropical fruit primarily bananas grown on Latin American plantations and sold in the United States and Europe The company was formed in  from the merger of the Boston Fruit Company with Minor C Keith s banana trading enterprises It flourished in the early and mid th century and it came to control vast territories and transportation networks in Central America the Caribbean coast of Colombia and the West Indies Although it competed with the Standard Fruit Company later Dole Food Company for dominance in the international banana trade it maintained a virtual monopoly in certain regions some of which came to be called banana republics such as Costa Rica Honduras and Guatemala United Fruit had a deep and long lasting effect on the economic and political development of several Latin American countries Critics often accused it of exploitative neocolonialism and they described it as the archetypal example of the influence of a multinational corporation on the internal politics of the so called banana republics After a period of financial decline United Fruit merged with Eli M Black s AMK in  to become the United Brands Company In  Carl Lindner Jr transformed United Brands into the present day Chiquita Brands International Corporate history Early years In  U S railroad entrepreneur Henry Meiggs signed a contract with the government of Costa Rica to build a railroad connecting the capital city of San Jos to the port of Lim n in the Caribbean Meiggs was assisted in the project by his young nephew Minor C Keith who took over Meiggs s business concerns in Costa Rica after his death in  Keith began experimenting with the planting of bananas as a cheap source of food for his workers When the Costa Rican government defaulted on its payments in  Keith had to borrow   million from London banks and from private investors to continue the difficult engineering project In exchange for this and for renegotiating Costa Rica s own debt in  the administration of President Pr spero Fern ndez Oreamuno agreed to give Keith   acres   km of tax free land along the railroad plus a  year lease on the operation of the train route The railroad was completed in  but the flow of passengers proved insufficient to finance Keith s debt However the sale of bananas grown in his lands and transported first by train to Lim n then by ship to the United States proved very lucrative Keith eventually came to dominate the banana trade in Central America and along the Caribbean coast of Colombia United Fruit   Banana company staff in Jamaica as part of United Fruit Company campaign to promote tourism Docks of the United Fruit Company in New Orleans  In  Keith lost   million when Hoadley and Co a New York City broker went bankrupt He then traveled to Boston Massachusetts to participate in the merger of his banana trading company Tropical Trading and Transport Company with the rival Boston Fruit Company Boston Fruit had been established by Lorenzo Dow Baker a sailor who in  had bought his first bananas in Jamaica and by Andrew W Preston Preston s lawyer Bradley Palmer had devised a scheme for the solution of the participants cash flow problems and was in the process of implementing it The merger formed the United Fruit Company based in Boston with Preston as president and Keith as vice president Palmer became a permanent member of the executive committee and for long periods of time the director From a business point of view Bradley Palmer was United Fruit Preston brought to the partnership his plantations in the West Indies a fleet of steamships and his market in the U S Northeast Keith brought his plantations and railroads in Central America and his market in the U S South and Southeast At its founding United Fruit was capitalized at   million The company at Palmer s direction proceeded to buy or buy a share in  competitors assuring them of  of the banana import business in the United States then their main source of income The company catapulted into financial success Bradley Palmer overnight became a much sought after expert in business law as well as a wealthy man He later became a consultant to presidents and an adviser to Congress An illustration from The Golden Caribbean In  the United Fruit Company produced The Golden Caribbean A Winter Visit to the Republics of Colombia Costa Rica Spanish Honduras Belize and the Spanish Main via Boston and New Orleans written and illustrated by Henry R Blaney The travel book featured landscapes and portraits of the inhabitants pertaining to the regions where the United Fruit Company possessed land It also described the voyage of the United Fruit Company s steamer and Blaney s descriptions and encounters of his travels In  the government of Guatemala hired the United Fruit Company to manage the country s postal service and in  the United Fruit Company created the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company By  it had absorbed more than  rival firms acquiring a capital of  million and becoming the largest employer in Central America In  Sam Zemurray nicknamed Sam the Banana Man sold his Cuyamel Fruit Company to United Fruit and retired from the fruit business By then the company held a major role in the national economies of several countries and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy This led to serious labor disputes by the Costa Rican peasants involving more than  separate unions and   workers in the  Great Banana Strike one of the most significant actions of the era by trade unions in Costa Rica By the s the company owned   million acres   km of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase banana republic In  concerned that the company was mismanaged and that its market value had plunged Zemurray staged a hostile takeover Zemurray moved the company s headquarters to New Orleans Louisiana where he was based United Fruit went on to prosper under Zemurray s management Zemurray resigned as president of the company in  In addition to many other labor actions the company faced two major strikes of workers in South and Central America in Colombia in  and the Great Banana Strike of  in Costa Rica The latter was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective trade unions in Costa Rica since the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in  Labor laws in most banana production countries began to be tightened in the s United Fruit Company saw itself as being specifically targeted by the reforms and often refused to negotiate with strikers despite frequently being in violation of the new laws In  the government of Guatemala began expropriating unused United Fruit Company land to landless peasants The company responded by intensively lobbying the U S government to intervene and mounting a misinformation campaign to portray the Guatemalan government as communist In  the U S Central Intelligence Agency deposed the democratically elected government of Guatemala and installed a pro business military dictatorship In  it acquired the A W Restaurants United Brands   Corporate raider Eli M Black bought   shares of United Fruit in  becoming the company s largest shareholder In June  Black merged United Fruit with his own public company AMK owner of meat packer John Morrell to create the United Brands Company United Fruit had far less cash than Black had counted on and Black s mismanagement led to United Brands becoming crippled with debt The company s losses were exacerbated by Hurricane Fifi in  which destroyed many banana plantations in Honduras On February   Black committed suicide by jumping out a window from the th floor of the Pan Am Building in New York City Later that year the U S Securities and Exchange Commission exposed a scheme by United Brands dubbed Bananagate to bribe Honduran President Oswaldo L pez Arellano with   million plus the promise of another   million upon the reduction of certain export taxes Trading in United Brands stock was halted and L pez was ousted in a military coup Chiquita Brands International Main article Chiquita Brands International After Black s suicide Cincinnati based American Financial Group one of billionaire Carl Lindner Jr s companies bought into United Brands In August  Lindner took control of the company and renamed it Chiquita Brands International The headquarters was moved to Cincinnati in  By  the company s main offices left the United States and relocated to Switzerland Throughout most of its history United Fruit s main competitor was the Standard Fruit Company now the Dole Food Company Reputation The United Fruit Company is well known for bribing government officials in exchange for preferential treatment exploiting its workers paying little by way of taxes to the governments of the countries where it operated and working ruthlessly to consolidate monopolies Latin American journalists sometimes referred to the company as el pulpo the octopus and leftist parties in Latin America encouraged the company s workers to strike Criticism of the United Fruit Company became a staple of the discourse of the communist parties in several Latin American countries where its activities were often interpreted as illustrating Vladimir Lenin s theory of capitalist imperialism Major left wing writers in Latin America such as Carlos Luis Fallas of Costa Rica Ram n Amaya Amador of Honduras Miguel ngel Asturias and Augusto Monterroso of Guatemala Gabriel Garc a M rquez of Colombia Carmen Lyra of Costa Rica and Pablo Neruda of Chile denounced the company in their literature The Fruit Company Inc reserved for itself the most succulent piece the central coast of my own land the delicate waist of America It rechristened its territories Banana Republics and over the sleeping dead over the restless heroes who brought about the greatness the liberty and the flags it established the comic opera it abolished free will gave out imperial crowns encouraged envy attracted the dictatorship of flies flies sticky with submissive blood and marmalade drunken flies that buzz over the tombs of the people circus flies wise flies expert at tyranny Pablo Neruda La United Fruit Co  The business practices of United Fruit were also frequently criticized by journalists politicians and artists in the United States Little Steven released a song in  called Bitter Fruit with lyrics that referred to a hard life for a company far away and whose accompanying video depicted orange groves worked by peasants overseen by wealthy managers The lyrics and scenery are generic but United Fruit or its successor Chiquita was reputedly the target The integrity of John Foster Dulles s anti Communist motives has been disputed since Dulles and his law firm of Sullivan Cromwell negotiated the land giveaways to the United Fruit Company in Guatemala and Honduras John Foster Dulles s brother Allen Dulles who was head of the CIA under Eisenhower also did legal work for United Fruit The Dulles brothers and Sullivan Cromwell were on the United Fruit payroll for thirty eight years Recent research has uncovered the names of multiple other government officials who received benefits from United Fruit John Foster Dulles who represented United Fruit while he was a law partner at Sullivan Cromwell he negotiated that crucial United Fruit deal with Guatemalan officials in the s was Secretary of State under Eisenhower his brother Allen who did legal work for the company and sat on its board of directors was head of the CIA under Eisenhower Henry Cabot Lodge who was America s ambassador to the UN was a large owner of United Fruit stock Ed Whitman the United Fruit PR man was married to Ann Whitman Dwight Eisenhower s personal secretary You could not see these connections until you could and then you could not stop seeing them History in Latin America The United Fruit Company UFCO owned huge tracts of land in the Caribbean lowlands It also dominated regional transportation networks through its International Railways of Central America and its Great White Fleet of steamships In addition UFCO branched out in  by creating the Tropical Radio and Telegraph Company UFCO s policies of acquiring tax breaks and other benefits from host governments led to it building enclave economies in the regions in which a company s investment is largely self contained for its employees and overseas investors and the benefits of the export earnings are not shared with the host country One of the company s primary tactics for maintaining market dominance was to control the distribution of arable land UFCO claimed that hurricanes blight and other natural threats required them to hold extra land or reserve land In practice what this meant was that UFCO was able to prevent the government from distributing land to peasants who wanted a share of the banana trade The fact that the UFCO relied so heavily on manipulating land use rights to maintain their market dominance had a number of long term consequences for the region For the company to maintain its unequal land holdings it often required government concessions And this in turn meant that the company had to be politically involved in the region even though it was an American company In fact the heavy handed involvement of the company in often corrupt governments created the term banana republic which represents a servile dictatorship The term Banana Republic was coined by American writer O Henry Environmental effects The United Fruit Company s entire process of creating a plantation to farming the banana and the effects of these practices created noticeable environmental degradation when it was a thriving company Infrastructure built by the company was constructed by clearing out forests filling in low swampy areas and installing sewage drainage and water systems Ecosystems that existed on these lands were destroyed devastating biodiversity With a loss in biodiversity other natural processes within nature necessary for plant and animal survival are shut down Techniques used for farming were at fault for loss of biodiversity and harm to the land as well To create farm land the United Fruit Company would either clear forests as mentioned or would drain marshlands to reduce avian habitats and to create good soil for banana plant growth The most common practice in farming was called the shifting plantation agriculture This is done by using produced soil fertility and hydrological resources in the most intense manner then relocating when yields fell and pathogens followed banana plants Techniques like this destroy land and when the land is unusable for the company then they move to other regions Guatemala See also  Guatemalan coup d tat United Fruit Company lobbyingWhen President Jacobo rbenz Guzm n attempted a redistribution of land he was overthrown in the  Guatemalan coup d tat Although UFCO sometimes promoted the development of the nations where it operated its long term effects on their economy and infrastructure were often devastating In Central America the Company built extensive railroads and ports provided employment and transportation and created numerous schools for the people who lived and worked on Company land On the other hand it allowed vast tracts of land under its ownership to remain uncultivated and in Guatemala and elsewhere it discouraged the government from building highways which would have lessened the profitable transportation monopoly of the railroads under its control UFCO also destroyed at least one of those railroads upon leaving its area of operation In  the Guatemalan government of Colonel Jacobo rbenz elected in  was toppled by forces led by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas who invaded from Honduras Commissioned by the Eisenhower administration this military operation was armed trained and organized by the U S Central Intelligence Agency see Operation PBSuccess The directors of United Fruit Company UFCO had lobbied to convince the Truman and Eisenhower administrations that Colonel rbenz intended to align Guatemala with the Eastern Bloc Besides the disputed issue of rbenz s allegiance to communism UFCO was being threatened by the rbenz government s agrarian reform legislation and new Labor Code UFCO was the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala and the rbenz government s land reform program included the expropriation of  of UFCO land U S officials had little proof to back their claims of a growing communist threat in Guatemala however the relationship between the Eisenhower administration and UFCO demonstrated the influence of corporate interest on U S foreign policy United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles an avowed opponent of communism was also a member of the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell which had represented United Fruit His brother Allen Dulles director of the CIA was also a board member of United Fruit United Fruit Company is the only company known to have a CIA cryptonym The brother of the Assistant Secretary of State for InterAmerican Affairs John Moors Cabot had once been president of United Fruit Ed Whitman who was United Fruit s principal lobbyist was married to President Eisenhower s personal secretary Ann C Whitman Many individuals who directly influenced U S policy towards Guatemala in the s also had direct ties to UFCO After the overthrow of rbenz a military dictatorship was established under Carlos Castillo Armas Soon after coming to power the new government launched a concerted campaign against trade unionists in which some of the most severe violence was directed at workers on the plantations of the United Fruit Company Despite UFCO s government connections and conflicts of interest the overthrow of rbenz failed to benefit the company Its stock market value declined along with its profit margin The Eisenhower administration proceeded with antitrust action against the company which forced it to divest in  In  the company sold off the last of its Guatemalan holdings after over a decade of decline Even as the rbenz government was being overthrown in  a general strike against the company organized by workers in Honduras rapidly paralyzed that country and due to the United States concern about the events in Guatemala was settled more favorably for the workers in order for the United States to gain leverage for the Guatemala operation Cuba Company holdings in Cuba which included sugar mills in the Oriente region of the island were expropriated by the  revolutionary government led by Fidel Castro By April  Castro was accusing the company of aiding Cuban exiles and supporters of former leader Fulgencio Batista in initiating a seaborne invasion of Cuba directed from the United States Castro warned the U S that Cuba is not another Guatemala in one of many combative diplomatic exchanges before the U S organized the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of  Banana massacre Main article Banana massacre A strike by United Fruit workers broke out on  November  near Santa Marta on the Caribbean coast of Colombia On December  Colombian Army troops allegedly under the command of General Cort s Vargas opened fire on a crowd of strikers in the central square of Ci naga Estimates of the number of casualties vary from  to   The military justified this action by claiming that the strike was subversive and its organizers were Communist revolutionaries Congressman Jorge Eli cer Gait n claimed that the army had acted under instructions from the United Fruit Company The ensuing scandal contributed to President Miguel Abad a M ndez s Conservative Party being voted out of office in  putting an end to  years of Conservative rule in Colombia The first novel of lvaro Cepeda Samudio La Casa Grande focuses on this event and the author himself grew up in close proximity to the incident The climax of Garc a M rquez s novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is based on the events in Ci naga General Cort s Vargas issued the order to shoot arguing later that he had done so because of information that US boats were poised to land troops on Colombian coasts to defend American personnel and the interests of the United Fruit Company Vargas issued the order so the United States would not invade Colombia The telegram from Bogot Embassy to the U S Secretary of State dated December   stated I have been following Santa Marta fruit strike through United Fruit Company representative here also through Minister of Foreign Affairs who on Saturday told me government would send additional troops and would arrest all strike leaders and transport them to prison at Cartagena that government would give adequate protection to American interests involved The telegram from Bogot Embassy to Secretary of State date December   stated Situation outside Santa Marta City unquestionably very serious outside zone is in revolt military who have orders not to spare ammunition have already killed and wounded about fifty strikers Government now talks of general offensive against strikers as soon as all troopships now on the way arrive early next week The dispatch from U S Bogot Embassy to the U S Secretary of State dated December   stated I have the honor to report that the legal advisor of the United Fruit Company here in Bogot stated yesterday that the total number of strikers killed by the Colombian military authorities during the recent disturbance reached between five and six hundred while the number of soldiers killed was one The dispatch from the U S embassy to the U S Secretary of State dated January   stated I have the honor to report that the Bogot representative of the United Fruit Company told me yesterday that the total number of strikers killed by the Colombian military exceeded one thousand The Banana massacre is said to be one of the main events that preceded the Bogotazo the subsequent era of violence known as La Violencia and the guerrillas who developed in the bipartisan National Front period creating the ongoing armed conflict in Colombia The United Fruit Company in Honduras Attempt at state capture Further information State capture Main railroad station in La Ceiba Honduras in  Following the Honduran declaration of independence in  from the Central American Federation Honduras was in a state of economic and political strife due to constant conflict with neighboring countries for territorial expansion and control Liberal President Marco Aurelio Soto   saw instating the Agrarian Law of  as a way to make Honduras more appealing to international companies looking to invest capital into a promising host export driven economy The Agrarian Law would grant international multinational companies leniency in tax regulations along with other financial incentives Acquiring the first railroad concession from liberal President Miguel R D vila in  the Vaccaro brothers and Company helped set the foundation on which the banana republic would struggle to balance and regulate the relationships between American capitalism and Honduran politics Samuel Zemurray a small sized American banana entrepreneur rose to be another contender looking to invest in the Honduran agricultural trade In New Orleans Zemurray found himself strategizing with the newly exiled General Manuel Bonilla nationalist ex president of Honduras     and fomented a coup d tat against President D vila On Christmas Eve December  in clear opposition of the D vila administration Samuel Zemurray U S General Lee Christmas and Honduran General Manuel Bonilla boarded the yacht Hornet formerly known as the USS Hornet and recently purchased by Zemurray in New Orleans With a gang of New Orleans mercenaries and plenty of arms and ammunition they sailed to Roatan to attack then seize the northern Honduran ports of Trujillo and La Ceiba Unbeknownst to Zemurray he was being watched by the US Secret Service Having captured the aging fort at Roatan he quickly sold the Hornet to a Honduran straw buyer on the island to avoid falling foul of the Neutrality Act After successfully attacking the port of Trujillo the Hornet unexpectedly encountered the U S gunboat Tacoma and was towed back to New Orleans The nascent revolution continued apace Zemurray s media contacts having spread the word in advance President D vila was forced to step down with Francisco Bertrand becoming interim president until General Bonilla handily won the November  Honduran presidential elections In  General Bonilla quickly granted the second railroad concession to the newly incorporated Cuyamel Fruit Company owned by Zemurray The period of some of these exclusive railroad land concessions was up to  years The first railroad concession leased the national railroad of Honduras to the Vaccaro Bros and Co once Standard Fruit Company and currently Dole Food Company Zemurray granted his concession to the Tela Railroad Company another division within his own company Cuyamel Fruit Company s concession would also be awarded to the Tela Railroad Company United Fruit Company currently Chiquita Brands International would partner with President Bonilla in the exchange of access and control of Honduran natural resources plus tax and financial incentives In return President Bonilla would receive cooperation protection and a

market for bananas and giving birth to the banana republic Cuyamel Fruit Company and the Vaccaro Bros and Co would become known as being multinational enterprises Bringing western modernization and industrialization to the welcoming Honduran nation All the while Honduran bureaucrats would continue to take away the indigenous communal lands to trade for capital investment contracts as well as neglect the fair rights of Honduran laborers After the peak of the banana republic era resistance eventually began to grown on the part of small scale producers and production laborers due to the exponential rate in growth of the wealth gap as well as the collusion between the profiting Honduran government officials and the U S fruit companies United Fruit Co Standard Fruit Co Cuyamel Fruit Co versus the Honduran working and poor classes Due to the exclusivity of the land concessions and lack of official ownership documentation Honduran producers and experienced laborers were left with two options to regain these lands dominio util or dominio pleno Dominio util meaning the land was intended to be developed for the greater good of the public with a possibility of being the granted full private ownership versus dominio pleno was the immediate granting of full private ownership with the right to sell Based on the  Honduran agrarian law without being sanctioned the right their communal lands Honduran villages and towns could only regain these lands if granted by the Honduran government or in some cases it was permitted by U S companies such as United Fruit Co to create long term contracts with independent producers on devastatingly diseased infested districts Even once granted land concessions many were so severely contaminated with either the Panaman moko or sigatoka that it would have to reduce the acreage used and the amount produced or changed the crop being produced Additionally accusations were reported of the Tela Railroad Company placing intense requirements demanding exclusivity in distribution and unjustly denying crops produced by small scale farmers because they were deemed inadequate Compromise was attempted between small scale fruit producers and the multinationals enterprises but were never reached and resulted in local resistance The U S fruit corporations were choosing rural agriculture lands in Northern Honduras specifically using the new railroad system for their proximity to major port cities of Puerto Cortes Tela La Ceiba and Trujillo as the main access points of transport for shipments designated back to the United States and Europe To get an understanding of the dramatic increase in amount of bananas being exported firstly in the Atlantida the Vaccaro Brothers Standard Fruit oversaw the construction of  kilometers of railroad between  and  the expansion of the railroad led to a concomitant rise exports from   million bunches in  to   million in  Standard Fruit Cuyamel and the United Fruit Co combined surpassed past profit performances In  a record  million bunches left Honduran shores a volume that exceeded the combined exports of Colombia Costa Rica Guatemala and Panama Social welfare programs for employees of United Fruit Company U S food corporations such as United Fruit established community services and facilitates for mass headquartered production divisions settlements of banana plantations throughout their partnered host countries such in the Honduran cities of Puerto Cortes El Progreso La Ceiba San Pedro Sula Tela and Trujillo Because of the strong likelihood of these communities being in extremely isolated rural agricultural areas both American and Honduran workers were offered on site community services similar to those found in other company towns such as free furnished housing similar to barracks for workers and their immediate family members health care via hospitals clinics health units education   years for children younger dependents other laborers commissaries grocery retail religious United Fruit built on site churches and social activities agricultural training at the Zamorano Pan American Agricultural School and cultural contributions such as the restoration of the Mayan city Zaculeu in Guatemala According to a  study in Econometrica the UFCo had a positive and persistent effect on living standards in Costa Rica which had granted substantial land concessions to the company from  to  The reason is that the company invested heavily in local amenities such as education and health care in order to attract and maintain a sizable workforce Agriculture research and training Early th century Honduras agricultural brochure Samuel Zemurray employed agronomists botanists and horticulturists to aid in research studies for United Fruit in their time of crisis as early as  when the Panama disease first inhabited crops Funding specialized studies to treat Panama disease and supporting the publishing of such findings throughout the s s Zemurray consistently was an advocate for agricultural research and education This was first observed when Zemurray funded the first research station of Lancetilla in Tela Honduras in  and led by Dr Wilson Popenoe Zemurray also founded the Zamorano Pan American Agricultural School Escuela Agricola Panamericana in  with Dr Popenoe as the head agronomist There were certain requirements before a student could be accepted into the fully paid for  year program including additional expenses room and board clothing food stc a few being a male between the ages of  and   years of elementary education plus an additional  years of secondary Zemurray established a policy where The School is not for the training or improvement of the company s own personnel but represents an outright and disinterested contribution to the improvement of agriculture in Spanish America This was one way in which the United Fruit Company undertook to discharge its obligation of social responsibility in those countries in which it operates and even to help others Zemurray was so intensely adamant in his policy that students were not allowed to become employees at the United Fruit Company post graduation United fruit and labor challenges Invasive banana diseases Epidemic diseases would cyclically strike the banana enterprise in the form of Panama disease black sigatoka and Moko Ralstonia solanacearum Large investments of capital resources time tactical practices and extensive research would be necessary in search for a solution The agriculture research facilities employed by United Fruit pioneered in the field of treatment with physical solutions such as controlling Panama disease via flood fallowing and chemical formulations such as the Bordeaux mixture spray These forms of treatment and control would be rigorously applied by laborers on a daily basis and for long periods of time so that they would be as effective as possible Potentially toxic chemicals were constantly exposed to workers such as copper II sulfate in Bordeaux spray which is still used intensively today in organic and bio agriculture   dibromo  chloropropane in Nemagon the treatment for Moko or the sigatoka control process that began a chemical spray followed by an acid wash of bananas post harvesting The fungicidal treatments would cause workers to inhale fungicidal dust and come into direct skin contact with the chemicals without means of decontamination until the end of their workday These chemicals would be studied and proven to carry their own negative repercussions towards the laborers and land of these host nations While the Panama disease was the first major challenging and aggressive epidemic again United Fruit would be faced with an even more combative fungal disease Black sigatoka in  Within a year sigatoka plagued  of their Honduran crop and once again scientists would begin a search for a solution to this new epidemic By the end of  production resumed to its normal level for United Fruit after the application of Bordeaux spray but not without creating devastating blows to the banana production Between   the Tela Railroad Company banana output fell from   to   million bunches and this did not include independent farmers who also suffered from the same epidemics export figures confirm the devastating effect of the pathogen on non company growers between   their exports plummeted from   million bunches to a mere   bunches Without any positive eradication of sigatoka from banana farms due to the tropical environment the permanent fungicidal treatment was incorporated and promoted in every major banana enterprise which would be reflective in the time resources labor and allocation of expenses needed for rehabilitation Labor health risks Both United Fruit Company production laborers and their fellow railroad workers from the Tela Railroad Company were not only at constant risk from long periods of chemical exposure in the intense tropical environment but there was a possibility of contracting malaria yellow fever from mosquito bites or inhale the airborne bacteria of tuberculosis from infected victims In  El Prision Verde The Green Prison written by Ram n Amaya Amador a leading member of the Honduran Communist Party exposed the injustices of working and living conditions on banana plantations with the story of Martin Samayoa a former Bordeaux spray applicator This literary piece is the personal account of everyday life as an applicator and the experienced as well as witnessed injustices pre post exposure to the toxic chemicals within these fungicidal treatments and insecticides The Bordeaux spray in particular is a blue green color and many sources referring to its usage usually bring to light the apparent identification of those susceptible to copper toxicity based on their appearance after working For example Pericos parakeets was the nickname given to spray workers in Puerto Rico because of the blue green coloring left on their clothing after a full day of spraying In  there was only one documented case of vineyard workers being studied in Portugal as they worked with the Bordeaux spray whom all suffered similar health symptoms and biopsied to find blue green residue within the victim s lungs Little evidence was collected in the s s by either the American or Honduran officials to address these acute chronic and deadly effects and illnesses warranted from the chemical exposure such as tuberculosis long term respiratory problems weight loss infertility cancer and death Many laborers were discouraged to voice the pain caused from physical injustices that occurred from the chemicals penetrating their skin or by inhalation from fungicide fumes in long labor intensive hours spraying the applications Without any specialized health care targeted to cure these unabating ailments and little to no compensation of workers who did become gravely ill Bringing awareness to such matters especially against major powers such as United Fruit Co amongst other multinational companies and the involved national governments would be feat for any single man woman to prove and demand for change That is until the legalization of labor unionization and organized resistance Resistance and reformation Labor resistance although was most progressive in the s to the s there has been a consistent presence of abrasiveness towards multinational enterprises such as United Fruit General Bonilla s choice to approve the concessions without demanding the establishment of fair labor rights and market price nor enforce a comprise between small scale fruit producers and the conglomerate of U S fruit enterprises would create the foundation in which strife would ensue from political economic and natural challenges The first push for resistance began from the labor movement leading into the Honduran government s turn towards nationalism compliance with Honduran land and labor reformations   and the severance of U S multinational support in all host countries governmental affairs   As United Fruit battles with Honduran oppositions they also fight similar battles with the other host Central American nations let alone their own Great Depression and the rising threat of communism Labor unionization From  to  the power and economic hegemony allotted to the American multinational corporations by host countries was designed to bring nations such as Honduras out of foreign debt and economic turmoil all the while decreasing the expenses of production increasing the levels of efficiency and profit and thriving in a tariff free economic system However the growing demand for bananas surpassed the supply because of challenges such as invasive fruit diseases Panama sigtaoka and moko plus human illnesses from extreme working conditions chemical toxicity and communicable diseases Laborers began to organize protest and expose the conditions in what they were suffering from at the location of their division Small scale fruit producers would also join the opposition to regain equality in the market economy and push for the redistribution of the taken communal lands sold to American multinational corporations Referencing to the Honduran administrations from  to  business historian Marcelo Bucheli interpreted their acts of collusion and stated The dictators helped United Fruit s business by creating a system with little or no social reform and in return United Fruit helped them remain in power As the rise of dictatorship flourished under Tiburcio Car as Andino s national administration   and prevailed for  years until it was passed onto nationalist President Juan Manuel G lvez a former lawyer for the United Fruit Company The General Strike of  in Tela Honduras was largest organized labor opposition against the United Fruit company However it did involve the laborers from United Fruit Standard Fruit along with industrial workers from San Pedro Sula Honduran laborers were demanding fair pay economic rights checked national authority and eradication of imperialist capitalism The total number of protesters was estimated at greater than   On the th day an agreement was made between United Fruit and the mass of protesters leading to the end of the General Strike Under the administration of Galvez   strides were taken to put into effect the negotiated improvements of workers rights Honduran laborers gained the right for shorter work days paid holidays limited employee responsibility for injuries the improvement of employment regulation over women and children and the legalization of unionization In the summer of  the strike ended yet the demand for economic nationalism and social reform was just beginning to gain even more momentum going into the s s Nationalist movement By legalizing unionization the large mass of laborers were able to organize and act on the influences of nationalist movement communist ideology and becomes allies of the communist party As like in the neighboring nation of Cuba and the rise communism led by Fidel Castro the fight for nationalism spread to other Latin American nations and ultimately led to a regional revolution Aid was given to these oppressed Latin American nations by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Americans struggled to maintain control and protect their capital investment while building tensions grew between America the communist and nationalist parties The s energy crisis was a period where petroleum production reached its peak causing an inflation in price leading to petroleum shortages and a  year economic battle Ultimately the United Fruit Company among other multinational fruit enterprises would attempt to recover capital lost due to the oil crisis through the Latin American nations The United Fruit s plan for recovery would ensue by increasing taxation and reestablishing exclusivity contracts with small scale farmers The crisis forced local governments to realign themselves and follow protectionist policies Bulmer Thomas  The fight to not lose their control over Honduras and other sister host nations to communism failed yet the nature of their relationship did change to where the national government had the higher authority and control End of the Honduran banana republic era At the end of the s energy crisis Honduras was under the administration of Oswaldo Lopez Arellano after he seized control from President Ramon Villeda Morales Trying to redistribute the taken lands of Honduras President Arellano attempted to aid the Honduran people in regaining their economic independence but was stopped by President Ram n Ernesto Cruz Ucl s in  In  the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC was created and did not involve Costa Rica Guatemala Honduras Panama and Colombia Designed to strengthen the same nations that experienced extreme economic turmoil the authority and control of foreign multinational companies s energy crisis and the inflation of trade tariffs Through nullification of the concession contracts originally granted to the U S multinational companies Latin American countries were able to further their plan for progress but were met with hostility from the U S companies Later in  President Arellano approved a new agrarian reform granting thousands of acres of expropriated lands from the United Fruit Company back to Honduran people The worsened relations between the U S and the newly affirmed powers of the Latin American countries would bring all parties into the  banana War Aiding and abetting a terrorist organization Further information United Self Defense Forces of Colombia In March  Chiquita Brands pleaded guilty in a United States Federal court to aiding and abetting a terrorist organization when it admitted to the payment of more than   million to the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia AUC a group that the United States has labeled a terrorist organization since  Under a plea agreement Chiquita Brands agreed to pay  million in restitution and damages to the families of victims of the AUC The AUC had been paid to protect the company s interest in the region In addition to monetary payments Chiquita has also been accused of smuggling weapons   AK s to the AUC and in assisting the AUC in smuggling drugs to Europe Chiquita Brands admitted that they paid AUC operatives to silence union organizers and intimidate farmers into selling only to Chiquita In the plea agreement the Colombian government let Chiquita Brands keep the names of U S Citizens who brokered this agreement with the AUC secret in exchange for relief to  families Despite calls from Colombian authorities and human rights organizations to extradite the U S citizens responsible for war crimes and aiding a terrorist organization the U S Department of Justice has refused to grant the request citing conflicts of law As with other high profile cases involving wrongdoing by American companies abroad the U S State Department and the U S Department of Justice are very careful to hand over any American citizen to be tried under another country s legal system so for the time being Chiquita Brands International avoided a catastrophic scandal and instead walked away with a humiliating defeat in court and eight of its employees fired The Great White Fleet For group of United

Coccus Mill Calappa Steck Coccos Gaertn The coconut tree Cocos nucifera is a member of the palm tree family Arecaceae and the only living species of the genus Cocos The term coconut or the archaic cocoanut can refer to the whole coconut palm the seed or the fruit which botanically is a drupe not a nut They are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics The coconut tree provides food fuel cosmetics folk medicine and building materials among many other uses The inner flesh of the mature seed as well as the coconut milk extracted from it form a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics Coconuts are distinct from other fruits because their endosperm contains a large quantity of clear liquid called coconut water or coconut juice Mature ripe coconuts can be used as edible seeds or processed for oil and plant milk from the flesh charcoal from the hard shell and coir from the fibrous husk Dried coconut flesh is called copra and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking frying in particular as well as in soaps and cosmetics Sweet coconut sap can be made into drinks or fermented into palm wine or coconut vinegar The hard shells fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decoration The coconut has cultural and religious significance in certain societies particularly in the Austronesian cultures of the Western Pacific where it features in their mythologies songs and oral traditions The fall of its mature fruit has led to a preoccupation with death by coconut It also had ceremonial importance in pre colonial animistic religions It has also acquired religious significance in South Asian cultures where it is used in rituals of Hinduism It forms the basis of wedding and worship rituals in Hinduism It also plays a central role in the Coconut Religion founded in  in Vietnam Coconuts were first domesticated by the Austronesian peoples in Island Southeast Asia and were spread during the Neolithic via their seaborne migrations as far east as the Pacific Islands and as far west as Madagascar and the Comoros They played a critical role in the long sea voyages of Austronesians by providing a portable source of food and water as well as providing building materials for Austronesian outrigger boats Coconuts were also later spread in historic times along the coasts of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans by South Asian Arab and European sailors Based on these separate introductions coconut populations can still be divided into Pacific coconuts and Indo Atlantic coconuts respectively Coconuts were introduced by Europeans to the Americas during the colonial era in the Columbian exchange but there is evidence of a possible pre Columbian introduction of Pacific coconuts to Panama by Austronesian sailors The evolutionary origin of the coconut is under dispute with theories stating that it may have evolved in Asia South America or Pacific islands Trees grow up to  metres  feet tall and can yield up to  fruits per year though fewer than  is more typical Plants are intolerant to cold and prefer copious precipitation and full sunlight Many insect pests and diseases affect the species and are a nuisance for commercial production In  about  of the world s supply of coconuts was produced by Indonesia India and the Philippines Etymology The name comes from the old Portuguese word coco meaning head or skull after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features Description Coconut palm leaves Cocos nucifera is a large palm growing up to  metres  feet tall with pinnate leaves   m   ft long and pinnae   centimetres   ft long old leaves break away cleanly leaving the trunk smooth On fertile soil a tall coconut palm tree can yield up to  fruits per year but more often yields less than  Given proper care and growing conditions coconut palms produce their first fruit in six to ten years taking  to  years to reach peak production True to type dwarf varieties of Pacific coconuts have been cultivated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times These varieties were selected for slower growth sweeter coconut water and often brightly colored fruits Many modern varieties are also grown including the Maypan King and Macapuno These vary by the taste of the coconut water and color of the fruit as well as other genetic factors Fruit The niu kafa form of the fruits of wild and Indo Atlantic coconutsThe niu vai form of the fruits of domesticated Pacific coconuts Botanically the coconut fruit is a drupe not a true nut Like other fruits it has three layers the exocarp mesocarp and endocarp The exocarp is the glossy outer skin usually yellow green to yellow brown in color The mesocarp is composed of a fiber called coir which has many traditional and commercial uses Both the exocarp and the mesocarp make up the husk of the coconut while the endocarp makes up the hard coconut shell The endocarp is around  millimetres   inch thick and has three distinctive germination pores micropyles on the distal end Two of the pores are plugged the eyes while one is functional Palm heavy with fruit The interior of the endocarp is hollow and is lined with a thin brown seed coat around   mm   in thick The endocarp is initially filled with a multinucleate liquid endosperm the coconut water As development continues cellular layers of endosperm deposit along the walls of the endocarp up to  mm   in thick starting at the distal end They eventually form the edible solid endosperm the coconut meat or coconut flesh which hardens over time The small cylindrical embryo is embedded in the solid endosperm directly below the functional pore of the endosperm During germination the embryo pushes out of the functional pore and forms a haustorium the coconut sprout inside the central cavity The haustorium absorbs the solid endosperm to nourish the seedling Coconut fruits have two distinctive forms depending on domestication Wild coconuts feature an elongated triangular fruit with a thicker husk and a smaller amount of endosperm These allow the fruits to be more buoyant and make it easier for them to lodge into sandy shorelines making their shape ideal for ocean dispersal Domesticated Pacific coconuts on the other hand are rounded in shape with a thinner husk and a larger amount of endosperm Domesticated coconuts also have more amounts of coconut water These two forms are referred to by the Samoan terms niu kafa for the elongated wild coconuts and niu vai for the rounded domesticated Pacific coconuts A full sized coconut fruit weighs about   kilograms  pounds  ounce Coconuts sold domestically in coconut producing countries are typically not de husked Especially immature coconuts  to  months from flowering are sold for coconut water and softer jelly like coconut meat known as green coconuts young coconuts or water coconuts where the original coloration of the fruit is more aesthetically pleasing Whole mature coconuts  to  months from flowering sold for export however typically have the husk removed to reduce weight and volume for transport This results in the naked coconut shell with three pores more familiar in countries where coconuts are not grown locally De husked coconuts typically weigh around  to  grams  lb  oz to  lb  oz De husked coconuts are also easier for consumers to open but have a shorter postharvest storage life of around two to three weeks at temperatures of  to  C  to  F or up to  months at  to   C   to   F In comparison mature coconuts with the husk intact can be stored for three to five months at normal room temperature Roots Unlike some other plants the palm tree has neither a taproot nor root hairs but has a fibrous root system The root system consists of an abundance of thin roots that grow outward from the plant near the surface Only a few of the roots penetrate deep into the soil for stability This type of root system is known as fibrous or adventitious and is a characteristic of grass species Other types of large trees produce a single downward growing tap root with a number of feeder roots growing from it     adventitious roots may grow each about  cm   in large Decayed roots are replaced regularly as the tree grows new ones Inflorescence Inflorescence unfurling The palm produces both the female and male flowers on the same inflorescence thus the palm is monoecious However there is some evidence that it may be polygamomonoecious and may occasionally have bisexual flowers The female flower is much larger than the male flower Flowering occurs continuously Coconut palms are believed to be largely cross pollinated although most dwarf varieties are self pollinating Taxonomy Phylogeny Fossil Cocos zeylandica from the Miocene of New Zealand approximately the size of a strawberry at   cm    in long The evolutionary history and fossil distribution of Cocos nucifera and other members of the tribe Cocoseae is more ambiguous than modern day dispersal and distribution with its ultimate origin and pre human dispersal still unclear There are currently two major viewpoints on the origins of the genus Cocos one in the Indo Pacific and another in South America The vast majority of Cocos like fossils have been recovered generally from only two regions in the world New Zealand and west central India However like most palm fossils Cocos like fossils are still putative as they are usually difficult to identify The earliest Cocos like fossil to be found was Cocos zeylandica a fossil species described as small fruits around   cm    in   to   cm   to  in in size recovered from the Miocene  to   million years ago of New Zealand in  Since then numerous other fossils of similar fruits were recovered throughout New Zealand from the Eocene Oligocene and possibly the Holocene But research on them is still ongoing to determine their phylogenetic affinities Endt Hayward  have noted their resemblance to members of the South American genus Parajubaea rather than Cocos and propose a South American origin Conran et al  however suggests that their diversity in New Zealand indicate that they evolved endemically rather than being introduced to the islands by long distance dispersal In west central India numerous fossils of Cocos like fruits leaves and stems have been recovered from the Deccan Traps They include morphotaxa like Palmoxylon sundaran Palmoxylon insignae and Palmocarpon cocoides Cocos like fossils of fruits include Cocos intertrappeansis Cocos pantii and Cocos sahnii They also include fossil fruits that have been tentatively identified as modern Cocos nucifera These include two specimens named Cocos palaeonucifera and Cocos binoriensis both dated by their authors to the Maastrichtian Danian of the early Tertiary  to  million years ago C binoriensis has been claimed by their authors to be the earliest known fossil of Cocos nucifera Outside of New Zealand and India only two other regions have reported Cocos like fossils namely Australia and Colombia In Australia a Cocos like fossil fruit measuring  cm   cm    in    in were recovered from the Chinchilla Sand Formation dated to the latest Pliocene or basal Pleistocene Rigby  assigned them to modern Cocos nucifera based on its size In Colombia a single Cocos like fruit was recovered from the middle to late Paleocene Cerrej n Formation The fruit however was compacted in the fossilization process and it was not possible to determine if it had the diagnostic three pores that characterize members of the tribe Cocoseae Nevertheless Gomez Navarro et al  assigned it to Cocos based on the size and the ridged shape of the fruit Further complicating measures to determine the evolutionary history of Cocos is the genetic diversity present within C nucifera as well as its relatedness to other palms Phylogenetic evidence supports the closest relatives of Cocos being either Syagrus or Attalea both of which are found in South America However Cocos is not thought to be indigenous to South America and the highest genetic diversity is present in Asian Cocos indicating that at least the modern species Cocos nucifera is native to there In addition fossils of potential Cocos ancestors have been recovered from both Colombia and India In order to resolve this enigma a  study proposed that the ancestors of Cocos had likely originated on the Caribbean coast of what is now Colombia and during the Eocene the ancestral Cocos performed a long distance dispersal across the Atlantic Ocean to North Africa From here island hopping via coral atolls lining the Tethys Sea potentially boosted by ocean currents at the time would have proved crucial to dispersal eventually allowing ancestral coconuts to reach India The study contended that an adaptation to coral atolls would explain the prehistoric and modern distributions of Cocos would have provided the necessary evolutionary pressures and would account for morphological factors such as a thick husk to protect against ocean degradation and provide a moist medium in which to germinate on sparse atolls Etymology The name coconut is derived from the th century Portuguese word coco meaning head or skull after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features Coco and coconut apparently came from  encounters by Portuguese and Spanish explorers with Pacific Islanders with the coconut shell reminding them of a ghost or witch in Portuguese folklore called coco also c ca In the West it was originally called nux indica a name used by Marco Polo in  while in Sumatra He took the term from the Arabs who called it jawz hind translating to Indian nut Thenga its Tamil Malayalam name was used in the detailed description of coconut found in Itinerario by Ludovico di Varthema published in  and also in the later Hortus Indicus Malabaricus Carl Linnaeus first wanted to name the coconut genus Coccus from latinizing the Portuguese word coco because he saw works by other botanists in middle of the th century use the name as well He consulted the catalogue Herbarium Amboinense by Georg Eberhard Rumphius where Rumphius said that coccus was a homonym of coccum and coccus from Greek kokkos meaning grain or berry but Romans identified coccus with kermes insects Rumphius preferred the word cocus as a replacement However the word cocus could also mean cook like coquus in Latin so Linnaeus chose Cocos directly from the Portuguese word coco instead The specific name nucifera is derived from the Latin words nux nut and fera bearing for nut bearing Distribution and habitat Coconuts have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution due to human cultivation and dispersal However their original distribution was in the Central Indo Pacific in the regions of Maritime Southeast Asia and Melanesia Origin See also Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia Austronesian peoples and Genomics of domestication Chronological dispersal of Austronesian peoples across the Indo Pacific Modern genetic studies have identified the center of origin of coconuts as being the Central Indo Pacific the region between western Southeast Asia and Melanesia where it shows greatest genetic diversity Their cultivation and spread was closely tied to the early migrations of the Austronesian peoples who carried coconuts as canoe plants to islands they settled The similarities of the local names in the Austronesian region is also cited as evidence that the plant originated in the region For example the Polynesian and Melanesian term niu Tagalog and Chamorro term niyog and the Malay word nyiur or nyior Other evidence for a Central Indo Pacific origin is the native range of the coconut crab and the higher amounts of C nucifera specific insect pests in the region  in comparison to the Americas  and Africa  Geographical distributions of Indo Atlantic and Pacific coconut subpopulations and their genetic composition Gunn et al  Inferred historical introduction of coconuts from the original centers of diversity in the Indian subcontinent and Island Southeast Asia A study in  identified two highly genetically differentiated subpopulations of coconuts one originating from Island Southeast Asia the Pacific group and the other from the southern margins of the Indian subcontinent the Indo Atlantic group The Pacific group is the only one to display clear genetic and phenotypic indications that they were domesticated including dwarf habit self pollination and the round niu vai fruit morphology with larger endosperm to husk ratios The distribution of the Pacific coconuts correspond to regions settled by Austronesian voyagers indicating that its spread was largely the result of human introductions It is most strikingly displayed in Madagascar an island settled by Austronesian sailors at around  to  BP The coconut populations on the island show genetic admixture between the two subpopulations indicating that Pacific coconuts were first brought by the Austronesian settlers which then interbred with the later Indo Atlantic coconuts brought by Europeans from India A wa a kaulua double hulled canoe from Hawai i Catamarans were one of the early technological innovations of Austronesian peoples that allowed them to colonize the islands of the Indo Pacific and introduce coconuts and other canoe plants along their migration routes Genetic studies of coconuts have also confirmed pre Columbian populations of coconuts in Panama in South America However it is not native and displays a genetic bottleneck resulting from a founder effect A study in  showed that the coconuts in the Americas are genetically closest related to the coconuts in the Philippines and not to any other nearby coconut populations including Polynesia Such an origin indicates that the coconuts were not introduced naturally such as by sea currents The researchers concluded that it was brought by early Austronesian sailors to the Americas from at least   BP and may be proof of pre Columbian contact between Austronesian cultures and South American cultures It is further strengthened by other similar botanical evidence of contact like the pre colonial presence of sweet potato in Oceanian cultures During the colonial era Pacific coconuts were further introduced to Mexico from the Spanish East Indies via the Manila galleons In contrast to the Pacific coconuts Indo Atlantic coconuts were largely spread by Arab and Persian traders into the East African coast Indo Atlantic coconuts were also introduced into the Atlantic Ocean by Portuguese ships from their colonies in coastal India and Sri Lanka first introduced to coastal West Africa then onwards into the Caribbean and the east coast of Brazil All of these introductions are within the last few centuries relatively recent in comparison to the spread of Pacific coconuts Natural habitat The coconut palm thrives on sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salinity It prefers areas with abundant sunlight and regular rainfall     mm annually which makes colonizing shorelines of the tropics relatively straightforward Coconuts also need high humidity at least   for optimum growth which is why they are rarely seen in areas with low humidity However they can be found in humid areas with low annual precipitation such as in Karachi Pakistan which receives only about  mm    in of rainfall per year but is consistently warm and humid Coconut palms require warm conditions for successful growth and are intolerant of cold weather Some seasonal variation is tolerated with good growth where mean summer temperatures are between  and  C  and  F and survival as long as winter temperatures are above   C   F they will survive brief drops to  C  F Severe frost is usually fatal although they have been known to recover from temperatures of  C  F Due to this there are not many coconut palms in California They may grow but not fruit properly in areas with insufficient warmth or sunlight such as Bermuda The conditions required for coconut trees to grow without any care are Mean daily temperature above   C   F every day of the year Mean annual rainfall above   mm  in No or very little overhead canopy since even small trees require direct sun The main limiting factor for most locations which satisfy the rainfall and temperature requirements is canopy growth except those locations near coastlines where the sandy soil and salt spray limit the growth of most other trees Domestication Wild coconuts are naturally restricted to coastal areas in sandy saline soils The fruit is adapted for ocean dispersal Coconuts could not reach inland locations without human intervention to carry seednuts plant seedlings etc and early germination on the palm vivipary was important Coconuts today can be grouped into two highly genetically distinct subpopulations the Indo Atlantic group originating from southern India and nearby regions including Sri Lanka the Laccadives and the Maldives and the Pacific group originating from the region between maritime Southeast Asia and Melanesia Linguistic archaeological and genetic evidence all point to the early domestication of Pacific coconuts by the Austronesian peoples in maritime Southeast Asia during the Austronesian expansion c  to  BCE Although archaeological remains dating to  to  BCE also suggest that the Indo Atlantic coconuts were also later independently cultivated by the Dravidian peoples only Pacific coconuts show clear signs of domestication traits like dwarf habits self pollination and rounded fruits Indo Atlantic coconuts in contrast all have the ancestral traits of tall habits and elongated triangular fruits Indo Atlantic coconut from eastern India with the elongated triangular niu kafa type fruitsDomesticated Pacific coconut from the Philippines with bright yellow rounded niu vai type fruits and a slow growing dwarf habit The coconut played a critical role in the migrations of the Austronesian peoples They provided a portable source of both food and water allowing Austronesians to survive long sea voyages to colonize new islands as well as establish long range trade routes Based on linguistic evidence the absence of words for coconut in the Taiwanese Austronesian languages makes it likely that the Austronesian coconut culture developed only after Austronesians started colonizing the Philippines The importance of the coconut in Austronesian cultures is evidenced by shared terminology of even very specific parts and uses of coconuts which were carried outwards from the Philippines during the Austronesian migrations Indo Atlantic type coconuts were also later spread by Arab and South Asian traders along the Indian Ocean basin resulting in limited admixture with Pacific coconuts introduced earlier to Madagascar and the Comoros via the ancient Austronesian maritime trade network Coconuts can be broadly divided into two fruit types the ancestral niu kafa form with a thick husked angular fruit and the niu vai form with a thin husked spherical fruit with a higher proportion of endosperm The terms are derived from the Samoan language and was adopted into scientific usage by Harries  The niu kafa form is the wild ancestral type with thick husks to protect the seed an angular highly ridged shape to promote buoyancy during ocean dispersal and a pointed base that allowed fruits to dig into the sand preventing them from being washed away during germination on a new island It is the dominant form in the Indo Atlantic coconuts However they may have also been partially selected for thicker husks for coir production which was also important in Austronesian material culture as a source for cordage in building houses and boats A coconut plantation in Efate Vanuatu The niu vai form is the domesticated form dominant in Pacific coconuts They were selected for by the Austronesian peoples for their larger endosperm to husk ratio as well as higher coconut water content making them more useful as food and water reserves for sea voyages The decreased buoyancy and increased fragility of this spherical thin husked fruit would not matter for a species that had started to be dispersed by humans and grown in plantations Niu vai endocarp fragments have been recovered in archaeological sites in the St Matthias Islands of the Bismarck Archipelago The fragments are dated to approximately  BCE suggesting that cultivation and artificial selection of coconuts were already practiced by the Austronesian Lapita people Coconuts can also be broadly divided into two general types based on habit the Tall var typica and Dwarf var nana varieties The two groups are genetically distinct with the dwarf variety showing a greater degree of artificial selection for ornamental traits and for early germination and fruiting The tall variety is outcrossing while dwarf palms are self pollinating which has led to a much greater degree of genetic diversity within the tall group The dwarf coconut cultivars are fully domesticated in contrast to tall cultivars which display greater diversity in terms of domestication and lack thereof The fact that all dwarf coconuts share three genetic markers out of thirteen which are only present at low frequencies in tall cultivars makes it likely that they all originate from a single domesticated population Philippine and Malayan dwarf coconuts diverged early into two distinct types They usually remain genetically isolated when introduced to new regions making it possible to trace their origins Numerous other dwarf cultivars also developed as the initial dwarf cultivar was introduced to other regions and hybridized with various tall cultivars The origin of dwarf varieties is Southeast Asia which contain the tall cultivars that are genetically closest to dwarf coconuts Sequencing of the genome of the tall and dwarf varieties revealed that they diverged  to  million years ago and that the dwarf variety arose through alterations in genes involved in the metabolism of the plant hormone gibberellin Another ancestral variety is the niu leka of Polynesia sometimes called the Compact Dwarfs Although it shares similar characteristics to dwarf coconuts including slow growth it is genetically distinct and is thus believed to be independently domesticated likely in Tonga Other cultivars of niu leka may also exist in other islands of the Pacific and some are probably descendants of advanced crosses between Compact Dwarfs and Southeast Asian Dwarf types Dispersal Coconut trees on a beach in Upolu Samoa Coconut fruit in the wild is light buoyant and highly water resistant It is claimed that they evolved to disperse significant distances via marine currents However it can also be argued that the placement of the vulnerable eye of the nut down when floating and the site of the coir cushion are better positioned to ensure that the water filled nut does not fracture when dropping on rocky ground rather than for flotation It is also often stated that coconuts can travel  days or   km   mi by sea and still be able to germinate This figure has been questioned based on the extremely small sample size that forms the basis of the paper that makes this claim Thor Heyerdahl provides an alternative and much shorter estimate based on his first hand experience crossing the Pacific Ocean on the raft Kon Tiki The nuts we had in baskets on deck remained edible and capable of germinating the whole way to Polynesia But we had laid about half among the special provisions below deck with the waves washing around them Every single one of these was ruined by the sea water And no coconut can float over the sea faster than a balsa raft moves with the wind behind it He also notes that several of the nuts began to germinate by the time they had been ten weeks at sea precluding an unassisted journey of  days or more Drift models based on wind and ocean currents have shown that coconuts could not have drifted across the Pacific unaided If they were naturally distributed and had been in the Pacific for a thousand years or so then we would expect the eastern shore of Australia with its own islands sheltered by the Great Barrier Reef to have been thick with coconut palms the currents were directly into and down along this coast However both James Cook and William Bligh put adrift after the Bounty mutiny found no sign of the nuts along this   km   mi stretch when he needed water for his crew Nor were there coconuts on the east side of the African coast until Vasco da Gama nor in the Caribbean when first visited by Christopher Columbus They were commonly carried by Spanish ships as a source of fresh water Coconut germinating on Punalu u Beach on the island of Hawai i These provide substantial circumstantial evidence that deliberate Austronesian voyagers were involved in carrying coconuts across the Pacific Ocean and that they could not have dispersed worldwide without human agency More recently genomic analysis of cultivated coconut C nucifera L has shed light on the movement However admixture the transfer of genetic material evidently occurred between the two populations Given that coconuts are ideally suited for inter island group ocean dispersal obviously some natural distribution did take place However the locations of the admixture events are limited to Madagascar and coastal east Africa and exclude the Seychelles This pattern coincides with the known trade routes of Austronesian sailors Additionally a genetically distinct subpopulation of coconut on the Pacific coast of Latin America has undergone a genetic bottleneck resulting from a founder effect however its ancestral population is the Pacific coconut from the Philippines This together with their use of the South American sweet potato suggests that Austronesian peoples may have sailed as far east as the Americas In the Hawaiian Islands the coconut is regarded as a Polynesian introduction first brought to the islands by early Polynesian voyagers also Austronesians from their homelands in the southern islands of Polynesia Specimens have been collected from the sea as far north as Norway but it is not known where they entered the water They have been found in the Caribbean and the Atlantic coasts of Africa and South America for less than  years the Caribbean native inhabitants do not have a dialect term for them but use the Portuguese name but evidence of their presence on the Pacific coast of South America antedates Columbus s arrival in the Americas They are now almost ubiquitous between  N and  S except for the interiors of Africa and South America The  coral atoll origin hypothesis proposed that the coconut had dispersed in an island hopping fashion using the small sometimes transient coral atolls It noted that by using these small atolls the species could easily island hop Over the course of evolutionary time scales the shifting atolls would have shortened the paths of colonization meaning that any one coconut would not have to travel very far to find new land Ecology Further information List of coconut palm diseases The Pacific flying fox Pteropus tonganus feeding on nectar and pollen from coconut flowers in Fiji Coconuts are susceptible to the phytoplasma disease lethal yellowing One recently selected cultivar the Maypan has been bred for resistance to this disease Yellowing diseases affect plantations in Africa India Mexico the Caribbean and the Pacific Region Konan et al  explains much resistance with a few alleles at a few microsatellites They find that Vanuatu Tall and Sri Lanka Green Dwarf are the most resistant while West African Tall breeds are especially susceptible The coconut palm is damaged by the larvae of many Lepidoptera butterfly and moth species which feed on it including the African armyworm Spodoptera exempta and Batrachedra spp B arenosella B atriloqua feeds exclusively on C nucifera B mathesoni feeds exclusively on C nucifera and B nuciferae Brontispa longissima coconut leaf beetle feeds on young leaves and damages both seedlings and mature coconut palms In  the Philippines imposed a quarantine in Metro Manila and  provinces to stop the spread of the pest and protect the Philippine coconut industry managed by some   million farmers The fruit may also be damaged by eriophyid coconut mites Eriophyes guerreronis This mite infests coconut plantations and is devastating it can destroy up to  of coconut production The immature seeds are infested and desapped by larvae staying in the portion covered by the perianth of the immature seed the seeds then drop off or survive deformed Spraying with wettable sulfur   or with Neem based pesticides can give some relief but is cumbersome and labor intensive In Kerala India the main coconut pests are the coconut mite the rhinoceros beetle the red palm weevil and the coconut leaf caterpillar Research into countermeasures to these pests has as of  yielded no results researchers from the Kerala Agricultural University and the Central Plantation Crop Research Institute Kasaragode continue to work on countermeasures The Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kannur under Kerala Agricultural University has developed an innovative

warmth and moisture to grow well and fruit Coconut palms are hard to establish in dry climates and cannot grow there without frequent irrigation in drought conditions the new leaves do not open well and older leaves may become desiccated fruit also tends to be shed The extent of cultivation in the tropics is threatening a number of habitats such as mangroves an example of such damage to an ecoregion is in the Petenes mangroves of the Yucat n Unique to most plants Coconut trees can be irrigated by sea water twice a week Cultivars Coconut has a number of commercial and traditional cultivars They can be sorted mainly into tall cultivars dwarf cultivars and hybrid cultivars hybrids between talls and dwarfs Some of the dwarf cultivars such as Malayan dwarf have shown some promising resistance to lethal yellowing while other cultivars such as Jamaican tall are highly affected by the same plant disease Some cultivars are more drought resistant such as West coast tall India while others such as Hainan Tall China are more cold tolerant Other aspects such as seed size shape and weight and copra thickness are also important factors in the selection of new cultivars Some cultivars such as Fiji dwarf form a large bulb at the lower stem and others are cultivated to produce very sweet coconut water with orange colored husks king coconut used entirely in fruit stalls for drinking Sri Lanka India Harvesting Left Harvesting coconuts in the Philippines is done by workers who climb the trees using notches cut into the trunk Center Worker harvesting coconuts in Veracruz Mexico using ropes and pulleys Right Coconut workers in the Maldives using a loop of cloth around the ankles The two most common harvesting methods are the climbing method and the pole method Climbing is the most widespread but it is also more dangerous and requires skilled workers Manually climbing trees is traditional in most countries and requires a specific posture that exerts pressure on the trunk with the feet Climbers employed on coconut plantations often develop musculoskeletal disorders and risk severe injury or death from falling Worker in the Philippines using a bamboo bridge network to collect sweet coconut sap from cut flower stalks for the production of lambanog a distilled alcoholic drink To avoid this coconuts workers in the Philippines and Guam traditionally use bolos tied with a rope to the waist to cut grooves at regular intervals on the coconut trunks This basically turns the trunk of the tree into a ladder though it reduces the value of coconut timber recovered from the trees and can be an entry point for infection Other manual methods to make climbing easier include using a system of pulleys and ropes using pieces of vine rope or cloth tied to both hands or feet using spikes attached to the feet or legs or attaching coconut husks to the trunk with ropes Modern methods use hydraulic elevators mounted on tractors or ladders Mechanical coconut climbing devices and even automated robots have also been recently developed in countries like India Sri Lanka and Malaysia The pole method uses a long pole with a cutting device at the end In the Philippines the traditional tool is known as the halabas and is made from a long bamboo pole with a sickle like blade mounted at the tip Though safer and faster than the climbing method its main disadvantage is that it does not allow workers to examine and clean the crown of coconuts for pests and diseases Determining whether to harvest is also important Gatchalian et al  developed a sonometry technique for precisely determining the stage of ripeness of young coconuts A system of bamboo bridges and ladders directly connecting the tree canopies are also utilized in the Philippines for coconut plantations that harvest coconut sap not fruits for coconut vinegar and palm wine production In other areas like in Papua New Guinea coconuts are simply collected when they fall to the ground A more controversial method employed by a small number of coconut farmers in Thailand and Malaysia use trained pig tailed macaques to harvest coconuts Thailand has been raising and training pig tailed macaques to pick coconuts for around  years Training schools for pig tailed macaques still exist both in southern Thailand and in the Malaysian state of Kelantan The practice of using macaques to harvest coconuts was exposed in Thailand by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA in  resulting in calls for boycotts on coconut products PETA later clarified that the use of macaques is not practiced in the Philippines India Brazil Colombia Hawaii and other major coconut producing regions Substitutes for cooler climates See also Cocoseae In cooler climates but not less than USDA Zone  a similar palm the queen palm Syagrus romanzoffiana is used in landscaping Its fruits are similar to coconut but smaller The queen palm was originally classified in the genus Cocos along with the coconut but was later reclassified in Syagrus A recently discovered palm Beccariophoenix alfredii from Madagascar is nearly identical to the coconut more so than the queen palm and can also be grown in slightly cooler climates than the coconut palm Coconuts can only be grown in temperatures above  C  F and need a daily temperature above  C  F to produce fruit Production by country Indonesia Indonesia is the world s largest producer of coconuts with a gross production of  million tonnes Philippines Red nata de coco in syrup from the Philippines Macapuno preserves sold in the United States The Philippines is the world s second largest producer of coconuts It was the world s largest producer for decades until a decline in production due to aging trees as well as typhoon devastation Indonesia overtook it in  It is still the largest producer of coconut oil and copra accounting for  of global production The production of coconuts plays an important role in the economy with  of cultivated land around   million hectares used for coconut plantations and approximately  to  of the population reliant on coconuts for their livelihood Two important coconut products were first developed in the Philippines macapuno and nata de coco Macapuno is a coconut variety with a jelly like coconut meat Its meat is sweetened cut into strands and sold in glass jars as coconut strings sometimes labeled as coconut sport Nata de coco also called coconut gel is another jelly like coconut product made from fermented coconut water India Coconuts being sold on a street in India Traditional areas of coconut cultivation in India are the states of Kerala Tamil Nadu Karnataka Puducherry Andhra Pradesh Goa Maharashtra Odisha West Bengal and Gujarat and the islands of Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar As per   statistics from Coconut Development Board of Government of India four southern states combined account for almost  of the total production in the country Tamil Nadu   Karnataka   Kerala   and Andhra Pradesh   Other states such as Goa Maharashtra Odisha West Bengal and those in the northeast Tripura and Assam account for the remaining productions Though Kerala has the largest number of coconut trees in terms of production per hectare Tamil Nadu leads all other states In Tamil Nadu Coimbatore and Tirupur regions top the production list The coconut tree is the official state tree of Kerala India In Goa the coconut tree has been reclassified by the government as a palm rather than a tree enabling farmers and developers to clear land with fewer restrictions and without needing permission from the forest department before cutting a coconut tree Middle East The main coconut producing area in the Middle East is the Dhofar region of Oman but they can be grown all along the Persian Gulf Arabian Sea and Red Sea coasts because these seas are tropical and provide enough humidity through seawater evaporation for coconut trees to grow The young coconut plants need to be nursed and irrigated with drip pipes until they are old enough stem bulb development to be irrigated with brackish water or seawater alone after which they can be replanted on the beaches In particular the area around Salalah maintains large coconut plantations similar to those found across the Arabian Sea in Kerala The reasons why coconut are cultivated only in Yemen s Al Mahrah and Hadramaut governorates and in the Sultanate of Oman but not in other suitable areas in the Arabian Peninsula may originate from the fact that Oman and Hadramaut had long dhow trade relations with Burma Malaysia Indonesia East Africa and Zanzibar as well as southern India and China Omani people needed the coir rope from the coconut fiber to stitch together their traditional seagoing dhow vessels in which nails were never used The know how of coconut cultivation and necessary soil fixation and irrigation may have found its way into Omani Hadrami and Al Mahra culture by people who returned from those overseas areas Coconut trees line the beaches and corniches of Oman The ancient coconut groves of Dhofar were mentioned by the medieval Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta in his writings known as Al Rihla The annual rainy season known locally as khareef or monsoon makes coconut cultivation easy on the Arabian east coast Coconut trees also are increasingly grown for decorative purposes along the coasts of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia with the help of irrigation The UAE has however imposed strict laws on mature coconut tree imports from other countries to reduce the spread of pests to other native palm trees as the mixing of date and coconut trees poses a risk of cross species palm pests such as rhinoceros beetles and red palm weevils The artificial landscaping may have been the cause for lethal yellowing a viral coconut palm disease that leads to the death of the tree It is spread by host insects that thrive on heavy turf grasses Therefore heavy turf grass environments beach resorts and golf courses also pose a major threat to local coconut trees Traditionally dessert banana plants and local wild beach flora such as Scaevola taccada and Ipomoea pes caprae were used as humidity supplying green undergrowth for coconut trees mixed with sea almond and sea hibiscus Due to growing sedentary lifestyles and heavy handed landscaping a decline in these traditional farming and soil fixing techniques has occurred Sri Lanka Sri Lanka is the world s fourth largest producer of coconuts and is the second largest producer of coconut oil and copra accounting for  of the global production The production of coconuts is the main source of Sri Lanka economy with  of cultivated land and   hectares used for coconut growing  Sri Lanka established its Coconut Development Authority and Coconut Cultivation Board and Coconut Research Institute in the early British Ceylon period United States In the United States coconut palms can be grown and reproduced outdoors without irrigation in Hawaii southern and central Florida and the territories of Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa the U S Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands Coconut palms are also periodically successful in the Lower Rio Grande Valley region of southern Texas and in other microclimates in the southwest In Florida wild populations of coconut palms extend up the East Coast from Key West to Jupiter Inlet and up the West Coast from Marco Island to Sarasota Many of the smallest coral islands in the Florida Keys are known to have abundant coconut palms sprouting from coconuts that have drifted or been deposited by ocean currents Coconut palms are cultivated north of South Florida to roughly Cocoa Beach on the East Coast and Clearwater on the West Coast Australia Coconuts are commonly grown around the northern coast of Australia and in some warmer parts of New South Wales However they are mainly present as decoration and the Australian coconut industry is small Australia is a net importer of coconut products Australian cities put much effort into de fruiting decorative coconut trees to ensure that mature coconuts do not fall and injure people Allergens Food Coconut oil is increasingly used in the food industry Proteins from coconut may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in some people In the United States the Food and Drug Administration declared that coconut must be disclosed as an ingredient on package labels as a tree nut with potential allergenicity Topical Cocamidopropyl betaine CAPB is a surfactant manufactured from coconut oil that is increasingly used as an ingredient in personal hygiene products and cosmetics such as shampoos liquid soaps cleansers and antiseptics among others CAPB may cause mild skin irritation but allergic reactions to CAPB are rare and probably related to impurities rendered during the manufacturing process which include amidoamine and dimethylaminopropylamine rather than CAPB itself Uses Immature green coconuts sold in Bangladesh for coconut water and their soft jelly like flesh The coconut palm is grown throughout the tropics for decoration as well as for its many culinary and nonculinary uses virtually every part of the coconut palm can be used by humans in some manner and has significant economic value Coconuts versatility is sometimes noted in its naming In Sanskrit it is kalpa vriksha the tree which provides all the necessities of life In the Malay language it is pokok seribu guna the tree of a thousand uses In the Philippines the coconut is commonly called the tree of life It is one of the most useful trees in the world Culinary Nutrition Coconut meat rawNutritional value per  g   oz Energy  kJ  kcal Carbohydrates  gSugars  gDietary

Eudicots Clade Rosids Order Malvales Family Malvaceae Subfamily Helicteroideae Tribe Durioneae Genus DurioL Type species Durio zibethinusL Species There are currently  recognised species see the List of Durio species The durian d ri n dj ri n is the edible fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio There are  recognized Durio species at least nine of which produce edible fruit Durio zibethinus native to Borneo and Sumatra is the only species available on the international market It has over  named varieties in Thailand and  in Malaysia as of  Other species are sold in their local regions Named in some regions as the king of fruits the durian is distinctive for its large size strong odour and thorn covered rind The fruit can grow as large as  cm  in long and  cm   in in diameter and it typically weighs  to  kg   to   lb Its shape ranges from oblong to round the colour of its husk from green to brown and its flesh from pale yellow to red depending on the species Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance whereas others find the aroma overpowering and unpleasant The smell evokes reactions ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust The persistence of its odour which may linger for several days has led some hotels and public transportation services in Southeast Asia to ban the fruit The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in Southeast Asian cuisines The seeds can also be eaten when cooked Etymology The name durian is derived from the Malay word duri meaning thorn a reference to the numerous prickly thorns on its rind combined with the noun building suffix an According to the Oxford English Dictionary the alternate spelling durion was first used in a  translation of The History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof by the Spanish explorer Juan Gonz lez de Mendoza There is one yt is called in the Malaca tongue Durion and is so good that it doth exceede in savour all others that euer they had seene or tasted Other historical variants include duryoen duroyen durean and dorian The name of the type species Durio zibethinus is derived from Viverra zibetha the large Indian civet a mammal known for its odour Taxonomy For a complete list of known species of Durio see List of Durio species Durio zibethinus one of the major food crops in Southeast AsiaDurian flowers are usually closed during the daytime Durio sensu lato has  recognised species Durio sensu stricto comprises  of these species The  additional species included in Durio s l are now considered by some to comprise their own genus Boschia Durio s s and Boschia have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics The crucial difference between the two is that anther locules open by apical pores in Boschia and by longitudinal slits in Durio s s These two genera form a clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae Cullenia These three genera together form a clade that is characterised by highly modified mono and polythecate as opposed to bithecate anthers The genus Durio is placed by some taxonomists in the family Bombacaceae or by others in a broadly defined Malvaceae that includes Bombacaceae and by others in a smaller family of just seven genera Durionaceae Durio is often included in Bombacaceae because of the presence of monothecate anthers as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows and angiosperms in general However the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae The authors of these studies hypothesise that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade comprising Malvaceae s l subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae A draft genome analysis of durian indicates it has about   coding and non coding genes among which a class called methionine gamma lyases which regulate the odour of organosulfur compounds may be primarily responsible for the distinct durian odour Genome analysis also indicated that the closest plant relative of durian is cotton Description Juvenile durian tree in Malaysia Mature specimens can grow up to  metres  feet Durian trees are large growing to   metres   feet in height depending on the species The leaves are evergreen elliptic to oblong and   centimetres   inches long The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx sepals and five rarely four or six petals Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods per year although the timing varies depending on the species cultivars and localities A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years The durian fruit can hang from any branch and matures roughly three months after pollination The fruit can grow up to  cm  in long and  cm  in in diameter and typically weighs one to three kilograms  to  lb Its shape ranges from oblong to round the colour of its husk green to brown and its flesh pale yellow to red depending on the species Among the thirty known species of Durio nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits D zibethinus D dulcis D grandiflorus D graveolens D kutejensis Durio lowianus D macrantha D oxleyanus and D testudinarius The fruit of many species has never been collected or properly examined however so other species may have edible fruit The durian is somewhat similar in appearance to the jackfruit an unrelated species D zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and available outside of its native region Since this species is open pollinated it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour size of flesh and seed and tree phenology In the species name zibethinus refers to the Indian civet Viverra zibetha There is disagreement over whether this name bestowed by Linnaeus refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them or to the durian smelling like the civet Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious nectar and give off a heavy sour and buttery odour These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen According to research conducted in Malaysia in the s durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats Eonycteris spelaea however a  study indicated two species D grandiflorus and D oblongus were pollinated by spiderhunters Nectariniidae and another species D kutejensis was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats Some scientists have hypothesised that the development of monothecate anthers and larger flowers compared to those of the remaining genera in Durioneae in the clade consisting of Durio Boschia and Cullenia was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to vertebrate pollination Cultivars Different cultivars of durian often have distinct colours D right has rich yellow flesh clearly distinguishable from another variety left Over the centuries numerous durian cultivars propagated by vegetative clones have arisen in Southeast Asia They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit but now are propagated by layering marcotting or more commonly by grafting including bud veneer wedge whip or U grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape such as the shape of the spines Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars which fetch higher prices in the market Malaysian varieties The Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture and Agro Based Industry started to register varieties of durian in  and now maintains a list of registered varieties where each cultivar is assigned a common name and a code number starting with D These codes are widely used through South East Asia and as of  there are over  registered varieties Many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture Horticulture and Agrotourism Show There are  common Malaysian varieties having favourable qualities of colour texture odour taste high yield and resistance against various diseases Musang King the most popular variety of durian in Malaysia Musang King D is the most popular durian breed from Malaysia rendered in Chinese as Mao Shan Wang which is usually the priciest of all cultivars The origin of the name Musang King dates back to the s when a man named Tan Lai Fook from Raub Pahang stumbled upon a durian tree in Gua Musang Kelantan He brought the tree branch back to Raub for grafting and this new breed attracted other cultivators The cultivar was named after Gua Musang its place of origin while the Chinese name references the palm civet the Malay meaning of musang Musang King is known for its bright yellow flesh and is like a more potent or enhanced version of the D Musang King is also the preferred cultivar in Singapore and Vietnam Other popular cultivars in Malaysia include D Sultan a popular variety known for its bittersweet taste XO which has a pale colour thick flesh with a tinge of alcoholic fermentation Tekka from Chinese Hokkien POJ tek kha which has a distinctive yellowish core in the inner stem D IOI which has a round shape medium size green and yellow outer skin colour and has flesh easy to dislodge The flesh is medium thick solid yellow in colour and sweet Red Prawn Udang Merah D found in the states of Pahang and Johor The fruit is medium sized with oval shape brownish green skin having short thorns The flesh is thick not solid yellow coloured and has a sweet taste Indonesian varieties Local durian in Cigudeg

Chanee D Thai gibbon Thai pronunciation Berserah or Green Durian or Tuan Mek Hijau D Thai Green Durian Thai pronunciation Kan Yao D Thai Long Stem Thai pronunciation Mon Thong D Thai Golden Pillow Thai pronunciation Kradum Thong Thai Golden Button Thai pronunciation and with no common name D Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour More than  cultivars of D zibethinus exist in Thailand Mon Thong is the most commercially sought after for its thick full bodied creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds while Chanee is the best in terms of its resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora Kan Yao is somewhat less common but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odourless at the same time Among all the cultivars in Thailand five are currently in large scale commercial cultivation Chanee Mon Thong Kan Yao Ruang and Kradum By  Thai government scientist Songpol Somsri had crossbred more than ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No  a cultivar without the characteristic odour Another hybrid Chantaburi No  develops the odour about three days after the fruit is picked which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour On  May  two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour Long Laplae and Lin Laplae were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally while he announced the dates for the annual durian fair of Laplae District and the name given to each cultivar Cultivation and availability This section may need to be rewritten to comply with Wikipedia s quality standards as Reason for rewrite You can help The talk page may contain suggestions April  A durian vendor in Malaysia Durian cultivation thrives in tropical areas ceasing growth when average daily temperatures fall below  C  F The fruit is native to Southeast Asia and is commonly found in countries like Malaysia Thailand Indonesia Singapore and the Philippines Durian is often called the king of fruits in Southeast Asia due to its popularity and rich nutritional profile D zibethinus is not grown in Brunei because consumers there prefer other species such as D graveolens D kutejensis and D oxleyanus These species are commonly distributed in Brunei and together with other species like D testudinarius and D dulcis constitute a genetically diverse crop source Although the durian is not native to Thailand Thailand is ranked the world s number one exporter of durian producing around   tonnes of durian per year   tonnes of which are exported to mainland China and Hong Kong Malaysia and Indonesia follow both producing about   tonnes each Of this Malaysia exported   tonnes in  Chantaburi in Thailand holds the World Durian Festival in early May each year This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand The Davao Region is the top producer of the fruit in the Philippines producing  of the country s total The Kadayawan Durian Festival is held in conjunction with the Kadayawan Festival an annual celebration in Davao City featuring durians and other fruits Durian was introduced into Australia in the early s and clonal material was first introduced in  Over thirty clones of D zibethinus and six other Durio species have been subsequently introduced into Australia China is the major importer purchasing   tonnes in  followed by Singapore with   tonnes and Taiwan with   tonnes In the same year the United States imported   tonnes mostly frozen and the European Community imported  tonnes Due to the increasing popularity of durian in China the price had risen up to  times over in four years in a market that was worth nearly m in  Malaysia negotiated a deal with China to export the whole fruit frozen for the first time to China starting in  previously only Thailand was permitted to export the whole fruit to China In  exports of durians to China have increased to   tonnes which was  times compared to  and a   percent increase from the year before The large majority of that was sourced from Thailand where China purchased at least US   billion worth or  percent of Thailand s fresh durian exports in that year according to the Thai Ministry of Commerce The durian is a seasonal fruit unlike some other non seasonal tropical fruits such as the papaya which are available throughout the year In Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore the season for durians is typically from June to August coinciding with that of the mangosteen Prices of durians are high due to postharvest changes and having a short shelf life in normal temperatures In Singapore in  the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D Sultan and Musang King Mao Shan Wang resulted in high retail prices The edible portion of the fruit known as the aril and usually referred to as the flesh or pulp only accounts for about   of the mass of the entire fruit By  Musang King farmers saw very large increases in the prices they received making the fruit far more lucrative than palm oil or rubber This led to an increase in durian plantation Flavour and odour This section may need to be rewritten to comply with Wikipedia s quality standards as Reason for rewrite You can help The talk page may contain suggestions April  Sign informing that the durian fruit is not allowed inside Singapore s Mass Rapid Transit Sliced deep fried durian in packages at a market in Thailand The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust Writing in  the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace provided a much quoted description of the flavour of the durian The five cells are silky white within and are filled with a mass of firm cream coloured pulp containing about three seeds each This pulp is the edible part and its consistence and flavour are indescribable A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind cream cheese onion sauce sherry wine and other incongruous dishes Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses but which adds to its delicacy It is neither acidic nor sweet nor juicy yet it wants neither of these qualities for it is in itself perfect It produces no nausea or other bad effect and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop In fact to eat Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour it is unsurpassed Wallace described himself as being at first reluctant to try it because of the aroma but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground and eating it out of doors I at once became a confirmed Durian eater He cited one traveller from  it is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all other fruits of the world according to those who have tasted it He cites another writer To those not used to it it seems at first to smell like rotten onions but immediately after they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food The natives give it honourable titles exalt it and make verses on it While Wallace cautions that the smell of the ripe fruit is certainly at first disagreeable later descriptions by Westerners are more graphic in detail Novelist Anthony Burgess writes that eating durian is like eating sweet raspberry blancmange in the lavatory Travel and food writer Richard Sterling says its odor is best described as pig excrement turpentine and onions garnished with a gym sock It can be smelled from yards away Despite its great local popularity the raw fruit is forbidden from some establishments such as hotels subways and airports including public transportation in Southeast Asia Other comparisons have been made with the civet sewage stale vomit skunk spray and used surgical swabs The wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great deal to do with the variability of durian odour itself Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas for example red durian D dulcis has a deep caramel flavour with a turpentine odour while red fleshed durian D graveolens emits a fragrance of roasted almonds Among the varieties of D zibethinus Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and less odorous than Malay ones The degree of ripeness has an effect on the flavour as well In  researchers from the Technical University of Munich identified ethanethiol and its derivatives as a reason for its fetid smell However the biochemical pathway by which the plant produces ethanethiol remained unclear such as the enzyme that releases ethanethiol The fruit s strong smell led to its ban from public transport systems in Singapore it is not used in many hotels because of its pungency Phytochemicals Hundreds of phytochemicals responsible for durian flavour and aroma include diverse volatile compounds such as esters ketones alcohols primarily ethanol and organosulfur compounds with various thiols Ethyl  methylbutanoate had the highest content among esters in a study of several varieties Sugar content primarily sucrose has a range of   among different durian varieties Durian flesh contains diverse polyphenols especially myricetin and various carotenoids including a rich content of beta carotene People in Southeast Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish the sweet like scent of its ketones and esters from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids Some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it pleasant and appealing This strong odour can be detected half a mile away by animals thus luring them In addition the fruit is highly appetising to diverse animals including squirrels mouse deer pigs sun bear orangutan elephants and even carnivorous tigers While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting with the seed being dispersed as a result The thorny armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree Ripeness and selection According to Larousse Gastronomique the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack However the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground whereas most cultivars of D zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour For some people in northern Thailand the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic In Malaysia and Singapore most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open In this state the flesh becomes richly creamy and slightly alcoholic The various preferences regarding ripeness among consumers make it hard to issue general statements about choosing a good durian A durian that falls off the tree continues to ripen for two to four days but after five or six days most would consider it overripe and unpalatable although some Thais proceed from that point to cook it with palm sugar creating a dessert called durian or thurian guan Uses Culinary Tempoyak made from fermented durian in Bandung West Java IndonesiaKetan durian glutinous rice with durian sauce in

markets though much of the paste is adulterated with pumpkin Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable except in the Philippines where all uses are sweet rather than savoury Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian When durian is minced with salt onions and vinegar it is called boder The durian seeds which are the size of chestnuts can be eaten whether they are boiled roasted or fried in coconut oil with a texture that is similar to taro or yam but stickier In Java the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested Young leaves and shoots of the durian are occasionally cooked as greens Sometimes the ash of the burned rind is added to special cakes The petals of durian flowers are eaten in the North Sumatra province of Indonesia and Sarawak of Malaysia while in the Moluccas islands the husk of the durian fruit is used as fuel to smoke fish The

Peninsula and orchards commonly cultivated in a wide region from India to New Guinea Four hundred years ago it was traded across present day Myanmar and was actively cultivated especially in Thailand and South Vietnam The earliest known European reference to the durian is the record of Niccol de Conti who travelled to Southeast Asia in the th century Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded de Conti s travels They have a green fruit which they call durian as big as a watermelon Inside there are five things like elongated oranges and resembling thick butter with a combination of flavours The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in Col quios dos simples e drogas da India published in  In  Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius During the early stages of its taxonomical study there was some confusion between durian and the soursop Annona muricata for both of these species had thorny green fruit The Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda meaning Dutch durian In the th century Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut Micha Boym a Jesuit missionary to China provided a  report on durian to European scholars Durio zibethinus Chromolithograph by Hoola Van Nooten circa  D zibethinus was introduced into Ceylon by the Portuguese in the th century and was reintroduced many times later It has been planted in the Americas but confined to botanical gardens The first seedlings were sent from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew to Auguste Saint Arroman of Dominica in  In Southeast Asia the durian has been cultivated for centuries at the village level probably since the late th century and commercially since the mid th century In My Tropic Isle Australian author and naturalist Edmund James Banfield tells how in the early th century a friend in Singapore sent him a durian seed which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of Queensland In  the British botanist E J H Corner published The Durian Theory or the Origin of the Modern Tree His theory was that endozoochory the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach arose before any other method of seed dispersal and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method in particular red durian D dulcis exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants However in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade Some genera possess these characters but others do not The most recent molecular evidence on which the most recent well supported circumscription of Durioneae is based therefore refutes Corner s Durian Theory Since the early s the domestic and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN region has increased significantly partly due to the increasing affluence of Southeast Asia In the early s a Durian craze in China led to a large increase in international trade of the fruit Culture and folk medicine Cultural influences A common local belief is that the durian is harmful when eaten with coffee or alcoholic beverages The latter belief can be traced back at least to the th century when Rumphius stated that one should not drink alcohol after eating durians as it will cause indigestion and bad breath In  J D Gimlette wrote in his Malay Poisons and Charm Cures that the durian fruit must not be eaten with brandy In  J R Croft wrote in his Bombacaceae In Handbooks of the Flora of Papua New Guinea that a feeling of morbidity often follows the consumption of alcohol too soon after eating durian Several medical investigations on the validity of this belief have been conducted with varying conclusions though a study by the University of Tsukuba finds the fruit s high sulphur content inhibits the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase causing a  percent reduction of the ability to clear toxins from the body Durian fruit is armed with sharp thorns capable of drawing blood Singapore s Esplanade building nicknamed The Durian The durian is commonly known as the king of fruits a label that can be attributed to its formidable look and overpowering odour In its native Southeast Asia the durian is an everyday food and portrayed in the local media in accordance with the cultural perception it has in the region The durian symbolised the subjective nature of ugliness and beauty in Hong Kong director Fruit Chan s  film Durian Durian lau lin piu piu and was a nickname for the reckless but lovable protagonist of the eponymous Singaporean TV comedy Durian King played by Adrian Pang Likewise the oddly shaped Esplanade building in Singapore Theatres on the Bay is often called The Durian by locals and The Big Durian is the nickname of Jakarta Indonesia A durian falling on a person s head can cause serious injuries because it is heavy armed with sharp thorns and can fall from a significant height Wearing a hardhat is recommended when collecting the fruit A common saying is that a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt However people have died from durian falling on their heads especially young children A saying in Malay and Indonesian durian runtuh which translates to getting hit by a durian is the equivalent of the English phrase windfall gain Nevertheless signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia Strong nylon or woven rope netting is often strung between durian trees in orchards serving a threefold purpose the nets aid in the collection of the mature fruits deter ground level scavengers and prevent the durians from falling onto people A naturally spineless variety of durian growing wild in Davao Philippines was discovered in the s fruits borne from these seeds also lacked spines Since the bases of the scales develop into spines as the fruit matures sometimes spineless durians are produced artificially by scraping scales off immature fruits In Malaysia a spineless durian clone D is registered by Agriculture Department on  June  It was called Durian Botak Bald Durian In Indonesia Ir Sumeru Ashari head of Durian Research Centre Universitas Brawijaya reported spineless durian from Kasembon Malang Another cultivar is from Lombok Nusa Tenggara Barat Indonesia Animals such as Sumatran elephants and tigers are known to consume durians One of the names Thailand contributed to the list of storm names for Western North Pacific tropical cyclones was Durian which was retired after the second storm of this name in  Being a fruit much loved by a variety of wild beasts the durian sometimes signifies the long forgotten animalistic aspect of humans as in the legend of Orang Mawas the Malaysian version of Bigfoot and Orang Pendek its Sumatran version both of which have been claimed to feast on durians Folk medicine In Malaysia a decoction of the leaves and roots used to be prescribed as an antipyretic The leaf juice is applied on the head of a fever patient The most complete description of the medicinal use of the durian as remedies for fevers is a Malay prescription collected by Burkill and Haniff in  It instructs the reader to boil the roots of Hibiscus rosa sinensis with the roots of Durio zibethinus Nephelium longana Nephelium mutabile and Artocarpus integrifolius and drink the decoction or use it as a poultice Southeast Asian traditional beliefs as well as traditional Chinese food therapy consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen which is considered to have cooling properties Pregnant women or people with high blood pressure are traditionally advised not to consume durian The Javanese believe durian to have aphrodisiac qualities and impose a set of rules on what may or may not be consumed with it or shortly thereafter A saying in Indonesian durian jatuh sarung naik meaning the durian falls and the sarong comes up refers to this belief The warnings against the supposed lecherous quality of this fruit soon spread to the West the Swedenborgian philosopher Herman Vetterling commented on so called erotic properties of the durian in the early th century Environmental impact The high demand for durians in China has prompted a shift in Malaysia from small scale durian orchards to large scale industrial operations Forests are cleared to make way for large durian plantations compounding an existing deforestation problem caused by the cultivation of oil palms Animal species such as the small flying fox which pollinates durian trees and the Malayan tiger are endangered by the increasing deforestation of their habitats In the Gua Musang District the state government approved the conversion of  km   acres of forestry including indigenous lands of the Orang Asli to durian plantations The prevalence of the Musang King and Monthong varieties in Malaysia and Thailand respectively has led to concerns about a decrease in the durian s genetic diversity at the expense of higher quality varieties A  study of durian species in Kalimantan Indonesia found low genetic diversity suggestive of inbreeding depression and genetic drift Additionally these dominant hybrid varieties are more susceptible to pests and fungal diseases requiring the use of insecticides and fungicides that can weaken the trees See also Wikimedia Commons has media related to Durian Wikiquote has quotations related to Durian Breadfruit List of delicacies List of durian diseases and

apple guava is a small tree in the myrtle family Myrtaceae native to Mexico Central America the Caribbean and northern South America The name guava is also given to some other species in the genus Psidium such as strawberry guava Psidium cattleyanum and to the pineapple guava Feijoa sellowiana In   million tonnes of guavas were produced worldwide led by India with  of the total Botanically guavas are berries Apple guava flower White guava Types The most frequently eaten species and the one often simply referred to as the guava is the apple guava Psidium guajava Guavas are typical Myrtoideae with tough dark heavy leaves that are opposite simple elliptic to ovate and   centimetres   in long The flowers are white with five petals and numerous stamens The fruits are many seeded berries Etymology The term guava appears to have been in use since the mid th century The name derived from the Ta no a language of the Arawaks as guayabo for guava tree via the Spanish for guayaba It has been adapted in many European and Asian languages having a similar form Origin and distribution Guavas originated from an area thought to extend from Mexico Central America or northern South America throughout the Caribbean region Archaeological sites in Peru yielded evidence of guava cultivation as early as  BCE Guava was adopted as a crop in subtropical and tropical Asia parts of the United States from Tennessee and North Carolina southward as well as the west and Hawaii tropical Africa and Oceania Guavas were introduced to Florida US in the th century and are grown there as far north as Sarasota Chipley Waldo and Fort Pierce However they are a primary host of the Caribbean fruit fly and must be protected against infestation in areas of Florida where this pest is present Guavas are cultivated in several tropical and subtropical countries Several species are grown commercially apple guava and its cultivars are those most commonly traded internationally Guavas also grow in southwestern Europe specifically the Costa del Sol on M laga Spain and Greece where guavas have been commercially grown since the middle of the th century and they proliferate as cultivars Mature trees of most species are fairly cold hardy and can survive temperatures slightly colder than  C  F for short periods of time but younger plants will likely freeze to the ground Guavas are of interest to home growers in subtropical areas as one of the few tropical fruits that can grow to fruiting size in pots indoors When grown from seed guava trees can bear fruit in two years and can continue to do so for forty years Thai maroon guava a red apple guava cultivar Ecology Psidium species are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera mainly moths like the Ello Sphinx Erinnyis ello Eupseudosoma aberrans E involutum and Hypercompe icasia Mites like Pronematus pruni and Tydeus munsteri are known to be crop pests of the apple guava P guajava and perhaps other species The bacterium Erwinia psidii causes rot diseases of the apple guava The fruit is cultivated and favored by humans and many other animals such as birds consume it readily dispersing the seeds in their droppings In Hawaii strawberry guava P littorale has become an aggressive invasive species threatening extinction to more than  other plant species By contrast several guava species have become rare due to habitat destruction and at least one Jamaican guava P dumetorum is already extinct Guava wood is used for meat smoking in Hawaii and is used at barbecue competitions across the United States In Cuba and Mexico the leaves are used in barbecues Fruit Guava fruits usually  to  centimetres    to    in long are round or oval depending on the species They have a pronounced and typical fragrance similar to lemon rind but less sharp The outer skin may be rough often with a bitter taste or soft and sweet Varying between species the skin can be any thickness is usually green before maturity but may be yellow maroon or green when ripe The pulp inside may be sweet or sour and off white white guavas to deep pink red guavas The seeds in the central pulp vary in number and hardness depending on species

Order Malpighiales Family Calophyllaceae Genus Mammea Species M americana Binomial name Mammea americanaL Mammea americana commonly known as mammee mammee apple mamey mamey apple Santo Domingo apricot tropical apricot or South American apricot is an evergreen tree of the family Calophyllaceae whose fruit is edible It has also been classified as belonging to the family Guttiferae Juss  which would make it a relative of the mangosteen In certain Latin American countries Mammea americana is referred to as yellow mamey Spanish mamey amarillo to distinguish it from the unrelated but similar looking Pouteria sapota whose fruit is usually called red mamey mamey colorado or mamey rojo Description Tree leaves The mammee tree is   m   ft high and is similar in appearance to the southern magnolia Magnolia grandiflora Its trunk is short and reaches     m  ft  in  ft  in in diameter The tree s upright branches form an oval head Its dark green foliage is quite dense with opposite leathery elliptical leaves The leaves can reach  cm   in wide and twice as long The mammee flower is fragrant has four or six white petals and reaches     cm     in wide when fully blossomed The flowers are borne either singly or in clusters of two or three on short stalks A single flower can have pistils stamens or both so flowers can be male female or hermaphrodite on one tree Fruit A mammee apple The mammee apple is a berry though it is often misinterpreted to be a drupe It is round or slightly irregular with a brown or grey brown  mm thick rind In fact the rind consists of the exocarp and mesocarp of the fruit while the pulp is formed from the endocarp The stem is thick and short The mammee apple has more or less visible floral remnant at the apex Mammee apples diameters range from  to  cm   to   in When unripe the fruit is hard and heavy but its flesh slightly softens when fully ripe Beneath the skin is a white dry membrane whose taste is astringent and adheres to the flesh The flesh is orange or yellow not fibrous and can have various textures crispy or juicy firm or tender Generally the flesh smell is pleasant and appetizing Small fruits contain a single seed while larger ones might have up to four The seeds are brown rough and oval and around  cm   in long The juice of the seed leaves an indelible stain Propagation Propagation can be done by seed Germination takes place from  to  days Grafting is the preferred method of propagation Distribution and habitat Native to the Caribbean the tree is also widely cultivated in the tropics and Central America In Haiti the fruit is known as zabriko or abricot In  it was included by Oviedo in his Review of the Fruits of the New World It was then introduced to various regions in the Old World West Africa particularly Sierra Leone Zanzibar Southeast Asia and Hawaii In the United States the species is uniquely found in Hawaii and Florida In the latter state mammee apples were probably introduced from the Bahamas The mammea apple tree is confined to tropical or subtropical climates In Central America the species is found to grow up to an altitude of   m It thrives best in rich deep and well drained soil but is very adaptive it also grows on limestone in Jamaica in the oolithic limestone of the Bahamas and on ancient coral bedrock in Barbados as well as coral cays off the coast of Florida The tree is very sensitive to low temperatures but seems remarkably resistant to pests and diseases Uses Mammy apple mamey rawNutritional value per  g   oz Energy kJ  kcal Carbohydrates  gDietary fiber g Fat  g

grated seeds are mixed with rum or coconut oil to treat head lice and chiggers Underripe fruits are rich in pectin and the tree bark is high in tannin Culinary interest Though edible this fruit has received little attention worldwide The raw flesh can be served in fruit salads or with wine sugar or cream especially in Jamaica In the Bahamas the flesh is first put in salted water to remove its bitterness before cooking it with much sugar to make a sort of jam The flesh can also be consumed stewed In the French West Indies an aromatic liqueur eau cr ole or cr me cr ole is distilled from the mammee flowers This liqueur is believed to be tonic or digestive Other Various parts of the tree contain insecticidal substances especially the seed kernel In Puerto Rico mammee leaves are wrapped around young tomato plants to keep mole crickets and cutworms away In a similar way the bark gum is melted with fat in Jamaica and Mexico then applied to the feet to repel chiggers or fleas on animals The same effect is also obtained from infusions of half ripe fruits In the Virgin Islands the tannin from the bark is used to tan leather The mammee timber is heavy and hard yet easy to work it has

of fruit This article is about the fruit For other uses see Mango disambiguation Mango fruits single and halved A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica It originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar Bangladesh and northeastern India M indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars the Indian type and the Southeast Asian type Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called mangoes the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion Worldwide there are several hundred cultivars of mango Depending on the cultivar mango fruit varies in size shape sweetness skin color and flesh color which may be pale yellow gold green or orange Mango is the national fruit of India Pakistan and the Philippines while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh Etymology The English word mango plural mangoes or mangos originated in the th century from the Portuguese word manga from the Malay mangga and ultimately from the Tamil man mango tree kay unripe fruit vegetable The scientific name Mangifera indica refers to a plant bearing mangoes in India Description Mango trees grow to   metres   feet tall with a crown radius of   m   ft The trees are long lived as some specimens still fruit after  years In deep soil the taproot descends to a depth of  m  ft with profuse wide spreading feeder roots and anchor roots penetrating deeply into the soil The leaves are evergreen alternate simple   centimetres   inches long and   cm       in broad when the leaves are young they are orange pink rapidly changing to a dark glossy red then dark green as they mature The flowers are produced in terminal panicles   cm     in long each flower is small and white with five petals   millimetres     in long with a mild sweet fragrance Over  varieties of mangoes are known many of which ripen in summer while some give a double crop The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening The ripe fruit varies according to cultivar in size shape color sweetness and eating quality Depending on the cultivar fruits are variously yellow orange red or green The fruit has a single flat oblong pit that can be fibrous or hairy on the surface and does not separate easily from the pulp The fruits may be somewhat round oval or kidney shaped ranging from   centimetres   in in length and from  grams  oz to  kilograms  lb in weight per individual fruit The skin is leather like waxy smooth and fragrant with colors ranging from green to yellow yellow orange yellow red or blushed with various shades of red purple pink or yellow when fully ripe Ripe intact mangoes give off a distinctive resinous sweet smell Inside the pit   mm     in thick is a thin lining covering a single seed   cm     in long Mangoes have recalcitrant seeds which do not survive freezing and drying Mango trees grow readily from seeds with germination success highest when seeds are obtained from mature fruits Flowers and immature fruits on an Alphonso tree Unripe mangos in Rinc n Puerto Rico The seed inside of a mango pit A mango stone Taxonomy Carabao a typical Southeast Asian type polyembryonic mango cultivar Langra a typical Indian type monoembryonic mango cultivar Mangoes originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar Bangladesh and northeastern India The mango is considered an evolutionary anachronism whereby seed dispersal was once accomplished by a now extinct evolutionary forager such as a megafauna mammal From their center of origin mangoes diverged into two genetically distinct populations the subtropical Indian group and the tropical Southeast Asian group The Indian group is characterized by having monoembryonic fruits while polyembryonic fruits characterize the Southeast Asian group It was previously believed that mangoes originated from a single domestication event in South Asia before being spread to Southeast Asia but a  study found no evidence of a center of diversity in India Instead it identified a higher unique genetic diversity in Southeast Asian cultivars than in Indian cultivars indicating that mangoes may have originally been domesticated first in Southeast Asia before being introduced to South Asia However the authors also cautioned that the diversity in Southeast Asian mangoes might be the result of other reasons like interspecific hybridization with other Mangifera species native to the Malesian ecoregion Nevertheless the existence of two distinct genetic populations also identified by the study indicates that the domestication of the mango is more complex than previously assumed and would at least indicate multiple domestication events in Southeast Asia and South Asia Cultivars Main article List of mango cultivars There are many hundreds of named mango cultivars In mango orchards several cultivars are often grown to improve pollination Many desired cultivars are monoembryonic and must be propagated by grafting or they do not breed true A common monoembryonic cultivar is Alphonso an important export product considered the king of mangoes Cultivars that excel in one climate may fail elsewhere For example Indian cultivars such as Julie a prolific cultivar in Jamaica require annual fungicide treatments to escape the lethal fungal disease anthracnose in Florida Asian mangoes are resistant to anthracnose The current world market is dominated by the cultivar Tommy Atkins a seedling of Haden that first fruited in  in southern Florida and was initially rejected commercially by Florida researchers Growers and importers worldwide have embraced the cultivar for its excellent productivity and disease resistance shelf life transportability size and appealing color Although the Tommy Atkins cultivar is commercially successful other cultivars may be preferred by consumers for eating pleasure such as Alphonso Generally ripe mangoes have an orange yellow or reddish peel and are juicy for eating while exported fruit are often picked while underripe with green peels Although producing ethylene while ripening unripened exported mangoes do not have the same juiciness or flavor as fresh fruit Distribution and habitat Mango tree in Palestine From tropical Asia mangoes were introduced to East Africa by Arab and Persian traders in the ninth to tenth centuries The th century Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta reported it at Mogadishu It was spread further into other areas around the world during the Colonial Era The Portuguese Empire spread the mango from their colony in Goa to East and West Africa From West Africa they introduced it to Brazil from the th to the th centuries From Brazil it spread northwards to the Caribbean and eastern Mexico by the mid to late th century The Spanish Empire also introduced mangoes directly from the Philippines to western Mexico via the Manila galleons from at least the th century Mangoes were only introduced to Florida by  Cultivation The mango is now cultivated in most frost free tropical and warmer subtropical climates It is cultivated extensively in South Asia Southeast Asia East and West Africa the tropical and subtropical Americas and the Caribbean Mangoes are also grown in Andalusia Spain mainly in M laga province as its coastal subtropical climate is one of the few places in mainland Europe that permits the growth of tropical plants and fruit trees The Canary Islands are another notable Spanish producer of the fruit Other minor cultivators include North America in South Florida and the California Coachella Valley Hawai i and Australia Many commercial cultivars are grafted onto the cold hardy rootstock of the Gomera  mango cultivar originally from Cuba Its root system is well adapted to a coastal Mediterranean climate Many of the   mango cultivars are easily cultivated using grafted saplings ranging from the turpentine mango named for its strong taste of turpentine to the Bullock s Heart Dwarf or semidwarf varieties serve as ornamental plants and can be grown in containers A wide variety of diseases can afflict mangoes Mango production  Country Millions of tonnes India   China   Indonesia   Pakistan   Mexico   Brazil   World   includes mangosteens and guavas reported to FAOSTATSource FAOSTAT of the United Nations A breakthrough in mango cultivation was the use of potassium nitrate and ethrel to induce flowering in mangoes The discovery was made by Filipino horticulturist Ramon Barba in  and was developed from the unique traditional method of inducing mango flowering using smoke in the Philippines It allowed mango plantations to induce regular flowering and fruiting year round Previously mangoes were seasonal because they only flowered every  to  months The method is now used in most mango producing countries Production In  world production of mangoes report includes mangosteens and guavas was  million tonnes led by India with  of

peel and pulp such as the triterpene lupeol Mango peel pigments under study include carotenoids such as the provitamin A compound beta carotene lutein and alpha carotene and polyphenols such as quercetin kaempferol gallic acid caffeic acid catechins and tannins Mango contains a unique xanthonoid called mangiferin Phytochemical and nutrient content appears to vary across mango cultivars Up to  different carotenoids have been isolated from mango pulp the densest of which was beta carotene which accounts for the yellow orange pigmentation of most mango cultivars Mango leaves also have significant polyphenol content including xanthonoids mangiferin and gallic acid Flavor The flavor of mango fruits is conferred by several volatile organic chemicals mainly belonging to terpene furanone lactone and ester classes Different varieties or cultivars of mangoes can have flavors made up of different volatile chemicals or the same volatile chemicals in different quantities In general New World mango cultivars are characterized by the dominance of  carene a monoterpene flavorant whereas high concentration of other monoterpenes such as Z ocimene and myrcene as well as the presence of lactones and furanones is the unique feature of Old World cultivars In India Alphonso is one of the most popular cultivars In Alphonso mango the lactones and furanones are synthesized during ripening whereas terpenes and the other flavorants are present in both the developing immature and ripening fruits Ethylene a ripening related hormone well known to be involved in ripening of mango fruits causes changes in the flavor composition of mango fruits upon exogenous application as well In contrast to the huge amount of information available on the chemical composition of mango flavor the biosynthesis of these chemicals has not been studied in depth only a handful of genes encoding the enzymes of flavor biosynthetic pathways have been characterized to date Toxicity Contact with oils in mango leaves stems sap and skin can cause dermatitis and anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals Those with a history of contact dermatitis induced by urushiol an allergen found in poison ivy poison oak or poison sumac may be most at risk for mango contact dermatitis Other mango compounds potentially responsible for dermatitis or allergic reactions include mangiferin Cross reactions may occur between mango allergens and urushiol Sensitized individuals may not be able to eat peeled mangos or drink mango juice safely When mango trees are flowering in spring local people with allergies may experience breathing difficulty itching of the eyes or facial swelling even before flower pollen becomes airborne In this case the irritant is likely to be the vaporized essential oil from flowers During the primary ripening season of mangoes contact with mango plant parts primarily sap leaves and fruit skin is the most common cause of plant dermatitis in Hawaii Nutrition A raw

in tropical dry broadleaf forests sometimes co occurring with carob trees Description Morisonia speciosa is a tree or shrub that is   metres  ft  in  ft  in in height It has a dense crown and foliage with fine tortuous branches and smooth thornless dark green bark Its elliptic green leaves are simple and alternate ranging from   centimetres     in in length and   centimetres     in in width The margins of the leaves are simple with a prominent midrib on the underside and often notched at the tip with a small mucron or spine Morisonia speciosa has flowers with anisosepalous calyces which are distinctively decussate imbricate The floral nectaries have four dimorphic scales The pollen grains have a fine reticulate surface The yellowish flowers infloresce solitarily reaching   centimetres     in in length The fruit of Morisonia speciosa are green spherical berries with a shiny exterior They are   centimetres     in in diameter and hang from long peduncles They contain a yellow orange pulp and four to eight dark subglobose seeds which are strongly anisocotylary They have a compact major cotyledon and a reduced or suppressed minor cotyledon Human use The fruit seeds and flowers of Morisonia speciosa are edible The yellowish pulp of the fruit is very sweet and has a spicy flavor reminiscent of mangoes It is a significant source of dietary fiber vitamin C and magnesium The seeds and pulp have naturally occurring antioxidants The Toba and Wich peoples have traditionally used Morisonia speciosa for culinary and medicinal purposes The fruits are ripe when they fall from the tree Preservation of the fruit can be done through sun drying and underripe fruit may be cooked Preparation of the seeds involves boiling them and drying them in the sun They are then crushed and made into flour or a puree that is often combined with oil or fat The flowers of Morisonia speciosa have a bitter taste that can be removed by boiling Traditional medicinal uses for Morisonia speciosa include treatments for toothaches as an antidysenteric and against cold stomach The bark of Morisonia speciosa is ground and used in folk veterinary medicine for wound healing and as a treatment for skin myiasis The fruit has been known to be used for fishing bait and the leaves have been used to dye chaguar fibers Fruits of the plant are also eaten by gray brockets References a b Morisonia speciosa

commonly known as cambuizeiro guavaberry or rumberry is a species of plant in the family Myrtaceae It can be found across South and Central America and the West Indies in dry or moist coastal woodlands up to  metres above sea level The guavaberry which should not be confused with the guava is a close relative of camu camu Description Guavaberry fruits Guavaberry trees are slow growing and can reach   metres   ft tall They have red brown branches and small pink and white flowers The fruit which are roughly half the size of cherries are yellow orange dark red or purple with tanginess of a guava containing a small amount of translucent flesh surrounding a stone The fruit has moderate sweetness The fruit is rich in vitamin C with the darker colored fruit having higher concentrations There is great genetic variability within the species and Myrciaria floribunda can vary in form structure and appearance and that has given rise to a large number of botanical synonyms Distribution Guavaberry trees can be found growing wild in Central America South America Argentina Belize Bolivia Brazil Colombia Costa Rica and many Caribbean islands The guavaberry has also been introduced to Florida Hawaii Bermuda Philippines and Tanzania Uses Guavaberry Emporium Sint Maarten Guavaberry is used to make jams and drinks Guavaberry liqueur which is made from rum is a common Christmas drink on many of the islands particularly in Sint Maarten and the Virgin Islands The colonists from Denmark and Holland found it could flavor rum by infusion similar to infused schnapps In the Dominican Republic it is associated with the eastern town of San Pedro de Macor s which has a large population of Eastern Caribbean descent Guavaberry coquito is one of many coquito flavored drinks from Puerto Rico associated with Christmas The drink is made with spices guavaberry milk sugar coconut milk eggs and rum References Botanic Gardens Conservation International BGCI IUCN SSC Global Tree Specialist

Family Passifloraceae Genus Passiflora Species P edulis Binomial name Passiflora edulisSims  Passiflora edulis commonly known as passion fruit is a vine species of passion flower native to southern Brazil and Peru It is cultivated commercially in tropical and subtropical areas for its sweet seedy fruit The fruit is a pepo a type of berry round to oval either yellow or dark purple at maturity with a soft to firm juicy interior filled with numerous seeds The fruit is both eaten and juiced with the juice often added to other fruit juices to enhance aroma Etymology The passion fruit is so called because it is one of the many species of passion flower the English translation of the Latin genus name Passiflora Around  the name was given by missionaries in Brazil as an educational aid while trying to convert the indigenous inhabitants to Christianity its name was flor das cinco chagas or flower of the five wounds to illustrate the crucifixion of Christ with other plant components also named after an emblem in the Passion of Jesus Description Passiflora edulis is a perennial vine tendrils are borne in leaf axils and have a red or purple hue when young There are two main varieties a purple fruited type P edulis f edulis and the yellow fruited P edulis f flavicarpa Usually the vine produces a single flower    cm wide at each node The flower has  oblong green sepals and  white petals The sepals and petals are  mm in length and form a fringe The base of the flower is a rich purple with  stamens an ovary and a branched style The styles bend backward and the stigmas which are located on top of the styles have a very distinct head The fruit produced is entirely fleshy making it botanically a berry and is spherical to ovoid The outside color of the berry ranges from dark purple with fine white specks to light yellow The fruit is    cm in diameter purple fruits are smaller weighing around  grams while yellow fruits are closer to  grams The smooth leathery rind is   mm thick including a thick layer of pith Within the berry there are typically  brown seeds each   mm in length Each seed is surrounded by a membranous sac filled with pulpy juice The flavor of the juice is slightly acidic and musky The passion fruit s flavor can be compared to the guava fruit Varieties Yellow and purple passion fruit variety P edulis var flavicarpa comparison Several distinct varieties of passion fruit with clearly differing exterior appearances exist The bright yellow flavicarpa variety also known as yellow or golden passion fruit can grow up to the size of a grapefruit has a smooth glossy light and airy rind and has been used as a rootstock for purple passion fruit in Australia The dark purple edulis variety is smaller than a lemon though it is less acidic than yellow passion fruit and has a richer aroma and flavour Uses This section needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable

cultivated in Florida Hawaii and California They generally have to be protected from frost although certain cultivars have survived light frosts after heavy pruning of affected areas Pollination The flower of the yellow fruited form of the passion fruit plant is self sterile while that of the purple fruited form is self compatible In California it is reported that pollination of flowers is most effective when done by the carpenter bee There are three types of yellow passion fruit flowers classified by curvature of style To help assure the presence of carpenter bees some gardeners place decaying logs near the vines which provide shelter for the bees Diseases Viruses Passion fruit woodiness virus is one of the most well known viruses to the passion fruit It belongs to the Potyvirus group and can attack a plant at any age from nursery to mature plants Some features include yellow leaves that display distortion in the leaf length and shape As well as affecting the leaf this virus influences fruit shape and size Affected fruits become stone like and much smaller than normal with many fruits becoming scabbed and cracked The virus is spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids and mites Woodiness can also spread through vegetation propagation such as infected scions or contaminated tools There is no chemical control for this virus once the plant is infected but the use of clean planting material can reduce its dissemination One of the most serious viruses pertaining to vegetation is the cucumber mosaic virus In the passion fruit this virus appears with yellow mottling on leaves starting at random points on the vine and diminishing in intensity towards the tip Expanding leaves typically become twisted curl downward and develop a shoestring appearance as a result of a restriction of the leaf surface It is mobile and can spread easily through interactions with other plants such as brushing between leaves This virus is naturally transmitted through aphids and can also be transmitted mechanically through seedlings Varietal resistance is the primary management tool and eliminating weeds and infected perennial ornamentals that may harbor the virus is critical Once the plant has been infected there is no possible management of control for the virus Phytoplasma Overshooting is the term used when Phytoplasma a specialized bacterium attacks the phloem of a plant Phytoplasma infection is characterized by chlorotic small leaves shortening of internodes excessive lateral shoots and abnormal flowers Although there have been reports of this disease within the passion fruit plant many infected plants are affected without visible signs of disease Although Phytoplasma can be spread through grafting it can be inhibited by periodic inspection of plant nurseries and areas that have had past infections Overshooting responds to treatment with tetracycline a common broad spectrum antibiotic Bacteria Bacterial leaf spot which causes vein clearing forms bright yellow colonies causing infection and leaf wilt and eventually deterioration of fruit pulp especially of young fruits Under favorable conditions for the bacteria infection occurs through natural openings or wounds from other pathogens that affect leaf inter cellular spaces Fertilizers or a copper chloride and mancozeb mixture can control the intensity of the disease but are not a cure The bacterial grease spot of the passion fruit is caused by Pseudomonas syringae It appears with olive green to brown greasy looking spots or brown sunken circular lesions On a later stage a hard crust can cover the lesions showing a chlorotic halo Affecting mainly the stomata the grease spot thrives in high temperatures and high relative humidity To avoid infection measures that may be adopted include planting seeds from healthy plants and using existing healthy areas Fungicide controls can aid in preventing further infection Fungal diseases Collar rot disease is caused by the fungus Fusarium solani It is characterized by necrotic lesions at the collar region browning of the stem at soil level and dark discoloration of the stem The rotting stem interferes with food and water transport within the plant leading to withering of the plant until death Infection occurs mostly through contaminated soil and infected plants which cause the plants to survive for only a few weeks There are no chemical controls Management includes planting seedlings in unaffected areas and using clean tools The fungus called fusarium wilt commonly occurs in adult plants and is caused by Fusarium oxysporum The pathogen has ability to survive for long periods penetrating roots invading the xylem and preventing the transport of water and nutrients to other organs of the plant Once infected this disease causes leaves to yellow and browning of the vascular system until it wilts and dies It occurs in any type of soil infecting all plants Management of crops include planting clean seedlings uprooting and burning infected plants and using sterilized tools The anthracnose a canker caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporiodes is a pathogen of the passion fruit creating dark and sunken lesions of the trunk By attacking mature passion fruit trees these lesions cause intense defoliation and fruit rot Many leaves die due to the foliar lesions and the skin of fruits becomes papery Under warm and humid conditions this disease can worsen causing red and orange spores eventually killing the plant Infection is carried out through the residues of the passion flower infected seeds seedlings and cuttings Managing this disease involves a combination of using pathogen free seedlings eliminating infected areas and improving ventilation and light conditions Copper based fungicides on injured areas can prevent the spread of disease In culture Passion fruit flower is the national flower of Paraguay In  singer songwriter Paula Fuga released the popular song Lilikoi the Hawaiian

also known as the groundnut goober US pindar US or monkey nut UK is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics important to both small and large commercial producers It is classified as both a grain legume and due to its high oil content an oil crop World annual production of shelled peanuts was  million tonnes in  led by China with  of the world total Atypically among legume crop plants peanut pods develop underground geocarpy rather than above ground With this characteristic in mind the botanist Carl Linnaeus gave peanuts the specific epithet hypogaea which means under the earth The peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae or Leguminosae commonly known as the legume bean or pea family Like most other legumes peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria in root nodules The capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen containing fertilizer and improve soil fertility making them valuable in crop rotations The botanical definition of a nut is a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity Using this criterion the peanut is not a nut However peanuts are usually categorized as nuts for culinary purposes and in common English more generally Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds and as a culinary nut are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines Peanuts History The Arachis genus is native to South America east of the Andes around Peru Bolivia Argentina and Brazil Cultivated peanuts A hypogaea arose from a hybrid between two wild species of peanut thought to be A duranensis and A ipaensis The initial hybrid would have been sterile but spontaneous chromosome doubling restored its fertility forming what is termed an amphidiploid or allotetraploid Genetic analysis suggests the hybridization may have occurred only once and gave rise to A monticola a wild form of peanut that occurs in a few limited locations in northwestern Argentina or in southeastern Bolivia where the peanut landraces with the most wild like features are grown today and by artificial selection to A hypogaea The process of domestication through artificial selection made A hypogaea dramatically different from its wild relatives The domesticated plants are bushier more compact and have a different pod structure and larger seeds From this primary center of origin cultivation spread and formed secondary and tertiary centers of diversity in Peru Ecuador Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay Over time thousands of peanut landraces evolved these are classified into six botanical varieties and two subspecies as listed in the peanut scientific classification table Subspecies A h fastigiata types are more upright in their growth habit and have shorter crop cycles Subspecies A h hypogaea types spread more on the ground and have longer crop cycles The oldest known archeological remains of pods have been dated at about   years old possibly a wild species that was in cultivation or A hypogaea in the early phase of domestication They were found in Peru where dry climatic conditions are favorable for the preservation of organic material Almost certainly peanut cultivation antedated this at the center of origin where the climate is moister Many pre Columbian cultures such as the Moche depicted peanuts in their art Cultivation was well established in Mesoamerica before the Spanish arrived There the conquistadors found the tl lcacahuatl the plant s Nahuatl name hence the name in Spanish cacahuete offered for sale in the marketplace of Tenochtitlan Its cultivation was introduced in Europe in the th century through Spain particularly Valencia where it is still produced albeit marginally European traders later spread the peanut worldwide and cultivation is now widespread in tropical and subtropical regions In West Africa it substantially replaced a crop plant from the same family the Bambara groundnut whose seed pods also develop underground In Asia it became an agricultural mainstay and this region is now the largest producer in the world Peanuts were introduced to the US during the colonial period and grown as a garden crop Starting in  it was used as an animal feedstock until human consumption grew in the s George Washington Carver   championed the peanut as part of his efforts for agricultural extension in the American South where soils were depleted after repeated plantings of cotton He invented and promulgated hundreds of peanut based products including cosmetics taints paints plastics gasoline and nitroglycerin The United States Department of Agriculture initiated a program to encourage agricultural production and human consumption of peanuts in the late th and early th centuries Peanut butter was developed in the s in the United States It became well known after the Beech Nut company began selling peanut butter at the St Louis World s Fair of  Composition Nutrition Peanut

Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating   ounces per day of most nuts such as peanuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease Phytochemicals Peanuts contain polyphenols polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats phytosterols and dietary fiber in amounts similar to several tree nuts Peanut skins contain resveratrol which is under preliminary research for its potential effects on humans Oil A common cooking and salad oil peanut oil is  monounsaturated fats primarily oleic acid  polyunsaturated fats primarily linoleic acid and  saturated fats primarily palmitic acid Extractable from whole peanuts using a simple water and centrifugation method the oil is being considered by NASA s Advanced Life Support program for future long duration human space missions Botany Peanut flower The peanut is an annual herbaceous plant growing  to  cm  to  in tall As a legume it belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae also known as Leguminosae and commonly known as the legume bean or pea family Like most other legumes peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria in their root nodules The leaves are opposite and pinnate with four leaflets two opposite pairs no terminal leaflet each leaflet is  to  centimetres   to    in long and  to  cm   to    in across Like those of many other legumes the leaves are nyctinastic that is they have sleep movements closing at night The flowers are  to   cm   to   in across and yellowish orange with reddish veining They are borne in axillary clusters on the stems above ground and last for just one day The ovary is located at the base of what appears to be the flower stem but is a highly elongated floral cup Peanut fruits develop underground an unusual feature known as geocarpy After fertilization a short stalk at the base of the ovary often termed a gynophore but which appears to be part of the ovary elongates to form a thread like structure known as a peg This peg grows into the soil allowing the fruit to develop underground These pods technically called legumes are  to  centimetres  to  in long normally containing one to four seeds The shell of the peanut fruit consists primarily of a mesocarp with several large veins traversing its length Parts Peanut seed separated showing the cotyledon plumule and radicle Parts of the peanut include Shell outer covering in contact with soil Cotyledons two the main edible part Seed coat brown paper like covering of the edible part Radicle embryonic root at the bottom of the cotyledon which can be snapped off Plumule embryonic shoot emerging from the top of the radicle Toxicity Allergies Main article Peanut allergy Some people   of the United States population report that they experience allergic reactions to peanut exposure symptoms are specifically severe for this nut and can range from watery eyes to anaphylactic shock which is generally fatal if untreated Eating a small amount of peanuts can cause a reaction Because of their widespread use in prepared and packaged foods avoiding peanuts can be difficult Reading ingredients and warnings on product packaging is necessary to avoid this allergen Foods processed in facilities that also handle peanuts on the same equipment as other foods are required to carry such warnings on their labels Avoiding cross contamination with peanuts and peanut products along with other severe allergens like shellfish is a promoted and common practice of which chefs and restaurants worldwide are becoming aware The hygiene hypothesis of allergy states that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents like germs and parasites could be causing the increase in food allergies Studies comparing age of peanut introduction in Great Britain with introduction in Israel showed that delaying exposure to peanuts in childhood can dramatically increase the risk of developing peanut allergies Peanut allergy has been associated with the use of skin preparations containing peanut oil among children but the evidence is not regarded as conclusive Peanut allergies have also been associated with family history and intake of soy products Some school districts in the United States and elsewhere have banned peanuts or products containing peanuts However the efficacy of the bans in reducing allergic reactions is uncertain A  study in Canada found no difference in the percentage of accidental exposures occurring in schools prohibiting peanuts compared to schools allowing them Refined peanut oil will not cause allergic reactions in most people with peanut allergies However crude unrefined peanut oils have been shown to contain protein which may cause allergic reactions In a randomized double blind crossover study  people with proven peanut allergy were challenged with both crude peanut oil and refined peanut oil The authors concluded Crude peanut oil caused allergic reactions in  of allergic subjects studied and should continue to be avoided They also stated Refined peanut oil does not seem to pose a risk to most people with peanut allergy However they point out that refined peanut oil can still pose a risk to peanut allergic individuals if the oil that has previously been used for cooking foods containing peanuts is reused Varieties Cultivars in the United States There are many peanut cultivars grown around the world The market classes grown in the United States are Spanish Runner Virginia and Valencia Peanut production in the United States is divided into three major areas the southeastern United States region which includes Alabama Georgia and Florida the southwestern United States region which includes New Mexico Oklahoma and Texas and the third region in the general eastern United States which includes Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina In Georgia Naomi Chapman Woodroof is responsible for developing the breeding program of peanuts resulting in a harvest almost five times greater Certain cultivar groups are preferred for particular characteristics such as differences in flavor oil content size shape and disease resistance Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy salted nuts and peanut butter Spanish group The small Spanish types are grown in South Africa and the southwestern and southeastern United States Until   of the peanuts grown in the US state of Georgia were Spanish types but the trend since then has been larger seeded higher yielding more disease resistant cultivars Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts In the United States the Spanish group is primarily grown in New Mexico Oklahoma and Texas Cultivars of the Spanish group include Dixie Spanish Improved Spanish B GFA Spanish Argentine Spantex Spanette Shaffers Spanish Natal Common Spanish White Kernel Varieties Starr Comet Florispan Spanhoma Spancross OLin Tamspan  AT   Spanco Wilco I GG  GG  TMV  and Tamnut  Runner group Since  the southeastern US region has seen a shift to producing Runner group peanuts This shift is due to good flavor better roasting characteristics and higher yields when compared to Spanish types leading to food manufacturers preference for the use in peanut butter and salted nuts Georgia s production is now almost  Runner type Cultivars of Runners include Southeastern Runner   Dixie Runner Early Runner Virginia Bunch  Bradford Runner Egyptian Giant also known as Virginia Bunch and Giant Rhodesian Spanish Bunch Valencia and Virginia Bunch North Carolina Runner   Florunner Virugard Georgia Green Tamrun  Flavor Runner  Tamrun OL Tamrun OL AT  Andru  Southern Runner AT  Georgia Brown GK  and AT  Virginia group The large seeded Virginia group peanuts are grown in the US states of Virginia North Carolina Tennessee Texas New Mexico Oklahoma and parts of Georgia They are increasing in popularity due to the demand for large peanuts for processing particularly for salting confections and roasting in shells Virginia group peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit The bunch type is upright to spreading It attains a height of  to  cm  to  in and a spread of  to  cm  to  in with  to  cm  to  in rows that seldom cover the ground The pods are borne within  to  cm  to  in of the base of the plant Cultivars of Virginia type peanuts include NC  NC  NC C NC V  VA B NC C VA C R Gregory VA R Perry Wilson Hull AT VC  and Shulamit Valencia group Valencia peanuts Valencia group peanuts are coarse and have heavy reddish stems and large foliage In the United States large commercial production is primarily in the South Plains of West Texas and in eastern New Mexico near and south of Portales but they are grown on a small scale elsewhere in the South as the best flavored and preferred type for boiled peanuts They are comparatively tall reaching a height of  cm  in and a spread of  cm  in Peanut pods are borne on pegs arising from the main stem and the side branches Most pods are clustered around the base of the plant and only a few are found several inches away Valencia types are three to five seeded and smooth with no constriction of the shell between the seeds Seeds are oval and tightly crowded into the pods Typical seed weight is   to   g This type is used heavily for selling roasted and salted in shell peanuts and peanut butter Varieties include Valencia A and Valencia C Tennessee Red and Tennessee White groups These are alike except for the color of the seed Sometimes known also as Texas Red or White the plants are similar to Valencia types except the stems are green to greenish brown and the pods are rough irregular and have a

are often prepared in briny water and sold in streetside stands A distinction can be drawn between raw and green peanuts A green peanut is a term to describe farm fresh harvested peanuts that have not been dehydrated They are available from grocery stores food distributors and farmers markets during the growing season Raw peanuts are also uncooked but have been dried dehydrated and must be rehydrated before boiling usually in a bowl full of water overnight Once rehydrated the raw peanuts are ready to be boiled Peanut oil Main article Peanut oil Peanut oil Peanut oil is often used in cooking because it has a mild flavor and a relatively high smoke point Due to its high monounsaturated content it is considered more healthful than saturated oils and is resistant to rancidity The several types of peanut oil include aromatic roasted peanut oil refined peanut oil extra virgin or cold pressed peanut oil and peanut extract Refined peanut oil is exempt from allergen labeling laws in the United States Peanut butter Main article Peanut butter Peanut butter Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground dry roasted peanuts It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture such as salt sweeteners or emulsifiers Many companies have added twists on traditionally plain peanut butter by adding various flavor varieties such as chocolate birthday cake and cinnamon raisin Peanut butter is served as a spread on bread toast or crackers and used to make sandwiches notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich It is also used in a number of confections such as peanut flavored granola bars or croissants and other pastries The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter and itself consumes  million of peanut butter annually Peanut flour Main article Peanut flour Peanut flour is used in gluten free cooking Peanut proteins Peanut protein concentrates and isolates are commercially produced from defatted peanut flour using several methods Peanut flour concentrates about  protein are produced from dehulled kernels by removing most of the oil and the water soluble non protein components Hydraulic pressing screw pressing solvent extraction and pre pressing followed by solvent extraction may be used for oil removal after which protein isolation and purification are implemented Latin America Peanuts are particularly common in Peruvian and Mexican cuisine both of which marry indigenous and European ingredients For instance in Peru a popular traditional dish is picante de cuy a roasted guinea pig served in a sauce of ground peanuts ingredients native to South America with roasted onions and garlic ingredients from European cuisine Also in the Peruvian city of Arequipa a dish called ocopa consists of a smooth sauce of roasted peanuts and hot peppers both native to the region with roasted onions garlic and oil poured over meat or potatoes Another example is a fricassee combining a similar mixture with saut ed seafood or boiled and shredded chicken These dishes are generally known as aj es meaning hot peppers such as aj de pollo and aj de mariscos seafood aj es may omit peanuts In Mexico it is also used to prepare different traditional dishes such as chicken in peanut sauce encacahuatado and is used as the main ingredient for the preparation of other famous dishes such as red pipi n mole poblano and oaxacan mole negro Likewise during colonial times in Peru the Spanish used peanuts to replace nuts unavailable locally but used extensively in Spanish cuisine such as almonds and pine nuts typically ground or as a paste mixed with rice meats and vegetables for dishes like rice pilaf Throughout the region many candies and snacks are made using peanuts In Mexico it is common to find them in different presentations as a snack or candy salty Japanese peanuts praline enchilados or in the form of a traditional sweet made with peanuts and honey called palanqueta and even as peanut marzipan There is a similar form of peanut candy in Brazil called p de moleque made with peanuts and molasses which resembles the Indian chikki in form West Asia See also Israeli sweets and snack foods Crunchy coated peanuts called kabukim in Hebrew are a popular snack in Israel Kabukim are commonly sold by weight at corner stores where fresh nuts and seeds are sold though they are also available packaged The coating typically consists of flour salt starch lecithin and sometimes sesame seeds The origin of the name is obscure it may be derived from kabuk which means nutshell or husk in Turkish An additional variety of crunchy coated peanuts popular in Israel is American peanuts The coating of this variety is thinner but harder to crack Bamba puffs are a popular snack in Israel Their shape is similar to Cheez Doodles but they are made of peanuts and corn Southeast Asia Fried peanuts in the Philippines Peanuts are also widely used in Southeast Asian cuisine such as in Malaysia Vietnam and Indonesia where they are typically made into a spicy sauce Peanuts came to Indonesia from the Philippines where the legume was derived from Mexico during Spanish colonization One Philippine dish using peanuts is kare kare a mixture of meat and peanut butter Apart from being used in dishes fried shelled peanuts are a common inexpensive snack in the Philippines The peanuts are commonly served plain salted with garlic chips and variants including adobo and chili flavors Common Indonesian peanut based dishes include gado gado pecel karedok and ketoprak vegetable salads mixed with peanut sauce and the peanut based sauce satay Indian subcontinent Boiled groundnuts peanuts In the Indian subcontinent peanuts are a light snack usually roasted and salted sometimes with the addition of chilli powder and often sold roasted in pods or boiled with salt They are also made into dessert or sweet snack of peanut brittle by processing with refined sugar and jaggery Indian cuisine uses roasted crushed peanuts to give a crunchy body to salads they are added whole without pods to leafy vegetable stews for the same reason Another use is peanut oil for cooking Most Indians use mustard sunflower and peanut oil for cooking In South India groundnut chutney is eaten with dosa and idli as breakfast Peanuts are also used in sweets and savory items in South India and also as a flavor in tamarind rice Kovilpatti is known for its sweet peanut chikki or peanut brittle which is also used in savory and sweet mixtures such as Bombay mix West Africa Peanuts grow well in southern Mali and adjacent regions of the Ivory Coast Burkina Faso Ghana Nigeria and Senegal peanuts are similar in both agricultural and culinary qualities to the Bambara groundnut native to the region and West Africans have adopted the crop as a staple Peanut sauce prepared with onions garlic peanut butter paste and vegetables such as carrots cabbage and cauliflower can be vegetarian the peanuts supplying ample protein or prepared with meat usually chicken Peanuts are used in the Malian meat stew maafe In Ghana peanut butter is used for peanut butter soup nkate nkwan Crushed peanuts may also be used for peanut candies

Suya in Nigeria and Ghana East Africa Peanuts are a common ingredient of several types of relishes dishes which accompany nshima eaten in Malawi and in the eastern part of Zambia and these dishes are common throughout both countries Thick peanut butter sauces are also made in Uganda to serve with rice and other starchy foods Groundnut stew called ebinyebwa in Luganda speaking areas of Uganda is made by boiling ground peanut flour with other ingredients such as cabbage mushrooms dried fish meat or other vegetables Across East Africa roasted peanuts often in cones of newspaper are obtained from street vendors North America Fried curry peanuts The state of Georgia leads the United States in peanut production with  percent of the nation s peanut acreage and output In  farmers cultivated   acres of peanuts yielding of   billion pounds The most famous peanut farmer was Jimmy Carter of Sumter County Georgia who became U S president in  In the United States and Canada peanuts are used in candies cakes cookies and other sweets Individually they are eaten dry roasted with or without salt Ninety five percent of Canadians eat peanuts or peanut butter with the average consumption of  kilograms    lb of peanuts per person annually and  of Canadians consume peanut butter weekly In the United States peanuts and peanut butter are central to American dietary practices and are typically considered as comfort foods Peanuts were sold at fairs or by pushcart operators through the th century Peanut butter is a common peanut based food representing half of the American total peanut consumption and  million in annual retail sales Peanut soup is found on restaurant menus in the southeastern states In some southern portions of the US peanuts are boiled for several hours until soft and moist Peanuts are also deep fried sometimes within the shell Per person Americans eat   kg  lb of peanut products annually spending a total of  billion in peanut retail purchases Manufacturing

Industrial Peanuts have a variety of industrial end uses Paint varnish lubricating oil leather dressings furniture polish insecticides and nitroglycerin are made from peanut oil Soap is made from saponified oil and many cosmetics contain peanut oil and its derivatives The protein portion is used in the manufacture of some textile fibers Peanut shells are used in the manufacture of plastic wallboard abrasives fuel cellulose used in rayon and paper and mucilage glue Malnutrition Peanuts are used to help fight malnutrition Plumpy Nut MANA Nutrition and Medika Mamba are high protein high energy and high nutrient peanut based pastes developed to be used as a therapeutic food to aid in famine relief The World Health Organization UNICEF Project Peanut Butter and Doctors Without Borders have used these products to help save malnourished children in developing countries Peanuts can be used like other legumes and grains to make a lactose free milk like beverage peanut milk which is promoted in Africa as a way to reduce malnutrition among children Animal feed Peanut plant tops and crop residues can be used for hay The protein cake oilcake meal residue from oil processing is used as animal feed and soil fertilizer Groundnut cake is a livestock feed mostly used by cattle as protein supplements It is one of the most important and valuable feeds for all types of livestock and one of the most active ingredients for poultry rations Poor storage of the cake may sometimes result in its contamination by aflatoxin a naturally occurring mycotoxin that is produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus The major constituents of the cake are essential amino acids such as lysine and glutamine Other components are crude fiber crude protein and fat Some peanuts can also be fed whole to livestock for example those over the peanut quota in the US or those with a higher aflatoxin content than that permitted by the food regulations Peanut processing often requires dehulling the hulls generated in large amounts by the peanut industries can feed livestock particularly ruminants Cultivation Peanut pegs growing into the soil The tip of the peg once buried swells and develops into a peanut fruit Peanuts grow best in light sandy loam soil with a pH of    Their capacity to fix nitrogen means that providing they nodulate properly peanuts benefit little or not at all from nitrogen containing fertilizer and they improve soil fertility Therefore they are valuable in crop rotations Also the yield of the peanut crop itself is increased in rotations through reduced diseases pests and weeds For example in Texas peanuts in a three year rotation with corn yield  more than nonrotated peanuts Adequate levels of phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and micronutrients are also necessary for good yields Peanuts need warm weather throughout the growing season to develop well They can be grown with as little as  mm  in of water but for best yields need at least  mm  in Depending on growing conditions and the cultivar of peanut harvest is usually  to  days after planting for subspecies A h fastigiata types and  to  days after planting for subspecies A h hypogaea types Subspecies A h hypogaea types yield more and are usually preferred where the growing seasons are sufficiently long Cultivation of peanut crop at the Indian Directorate of Groundnut Research Junagadh Gujarat  Peanut plants continue to produce flowers when pods are developing therefore some pods are immature even when they are ready for harvest To maximize yield the timing of harvest is important If it is too early too many pods will be unripe if too late the pods will snap off at the stalk and remain in the soil For harvesting the entire plant including most of the roots is removed from the soil The pods are covered with a network of raised veins and are constricted between seeds The main yield limiting factors in semiarid regions are drought and high temperature stress The stages of reproductive development before flowering at flowering and at early pod development are particularly sensitive to these constraints Apart from nitrogen phosphorus and potassium other nutrient deficiencies causing significant yield losses are calcium iron and boron Biotic stresses mainly include pests diseases and weeds Among insects pests pod borers aphids and mites are of importance The most important diseases are leaf spots rusts and the toxin producing fungus Aspergillus Harvest of peanuts Bandjoun Cameroon  Harvesting occurs in two stages In mechanized systems a machine is used to cut off the main root of the peanut plant by cutting through the soil just below the level of the peanut pods The machine lifts the bush from the ground shakes it then inverts it leaving the plant upside down to keep the peanuts out of the soil This allows the peanuts to dry slowly to a little less than a third of their original moisture level over three to four days Traditionally peanuts were pulled and inverted by hand After the peanuts have dried sufficiently they are threshed removing the peanut pods from the rest of the bush peanuts must be dried properly and stored in dry conditions If they are too high in moisture or if storage conditions are poor they may become infected by the mold fungus Aspergillus flavus Many strains of this fungus release toxic and highly carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins Pests and diseases If peanut plants are subjected to severe drought during pod formation or if pods are not properly stored they may become contaminated with the mold Aspergillus flavus which may produce carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins Lower quality peanuts particularly where mold is evident are more likely to be contaminated The United States Department of Agriculture tests every truckload of raw peanuts for aflatoxin any containing aflatoxin levels of more than  parts per billion are destroyed The peanut industry has manufacturing steps to ensure all peanuts are inspected for aflatoxin Peanuts tested to have high aflatoxin are used to make peanut oil where the mold can be removed The plant leaves can also be affected by a fungus Alternaria arachidis Gallery Roasted Peanuts with shell A warning sign for the presence of peanuts and peanut dust Arachis hypogaea flower Peanut pegs penetrating the ground

edible fruit it is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae The pineapple is indigenous to South America where it has been cultivated for many centuries The introduction of the pineapple plant to Europe in the th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury Since the s pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations Pineapples grow as a small shrub the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit The plant normally propagates from the offset produced at the top of the fruit or from a side shoot and typically matures within a year Description Pineapple in the starting stagePineapple inflorescenceA young pineapple in flowerPineapple flowers close up The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial which grows to   to   m  ft  in to  ft  in tall on average although sometimes it can be taller The plant has a short stocky stem with tough waxy leaves When creating its fruit it usually produces up to  flowers although some large fruited cultivars can exceed this Once it flowers the individual fruits of the flowers join together to create a multiple fruit After the first fruit is produced side shoots called suckers by commercial growers are produced in the leaf axils of the main stem These suckers may be removed for propagation or left to produce additional fruits on the original plant Commercially suckers that appear around the base are cultivated It has  or more narrow fleshy trough shaped leaves that are  to  cm  to    ft long surrounding a thick stem the leaves have sharp spines along the margins In the first year of growth the axis lengthens and thickens bearing numerous leaves in close spirals After  to  months the stem grows into a spike like inflorescence up to  cm  in long with over  spirally arranged trimerous flowers each subtended by a bract In the wild pineapples are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds Certain wild pineapples are foraged and pollinated at night by bats Under cultivation because seed development diminishes fruit quality pollination is performed by hand and seeds are retained only for breeding In Hawaii where pineapples were cultivated and canned industrially throughout the th century importation of hummingbirds was prohibited The ovaries develop into berries which coalesce into a large compact multiple fruit The fruit of a pineapple is usually arranged in two interlocking helices often with  in one direction and  in the other each being a Fibonacci number The pineapple carries out CAM photosynthesis fixing carbon dioxide at night and storing it as the acid malate then releasing it during the day aiding photosynthesis Taxonomy The pineapple comprises five botanical varieties formerly regarded as separate species The genomes of three varieties including the wild progenitor variety bracteatus have been sequenced Image Varieties Distribution Ananas comosus var bracteatus L B Sm Coppens F Leal Brazil

the pineapple fruit was the  translation from the French of Andr Thevet s The New Found World or Antarctike where he refers to a Hoyriri a fruit cultivated and eaten by the Tupinamb people living near modern Rio de Janeiro and now believed to be a pineapple Later in the same English translation he describes the same fruit as a Nana made in the manner of a Pine apple where he used another Tupi word nanas meaning excellent fruit This usage was adopted by many European languages and led to the plant s scientific binomial Ananas comosus where comosus tufted refers to the stem of the plant Purchas writing in English in  referred to the fruit as Ananas but the Oxford English Dictionary s first record of the word pineapple itself by an English writer is by Mandeville in  Pineapple fruit whole and in longitudinal section Precolonial cultivation The wild plant originates from the Paran Paraguay River drainages between southern Brazil and Paraguay Little is known about its domestication but it spread as a crop throughout South America Archaeological evidence of use is found as far back as   BC   BP in Peru and  BC  AD   BP in Mexico where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs By the late s cropped pineapple was widely distributed and a staple food of Native Americans The first European to encounter the pineapple was Columbus in Guadeloupe on  November  The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by  The Red Spanish cultivar was also introduced by the Spanish from Latin America to the Philippines and it was grown for textile use from at least the th century Columbus brought the plant back to Spain and called it pi a de Indes meaning pine of the Indians The pineapple was documented in Peter Martyr s Decades of the New World  and Antonio Pigafetta s Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo   and the first known illustration was in Oviedo s Historia General de Las Indias  Old World introduction Britannia presented with cornucopiae including pineapples by allegories of Nature Industry and Science with an orangery in the background frontispiece of The Gardeners Dictionary  While the pineapple fascinated Europeans as a fruit of colonialism it was not successfully cultivated in Europe until Pieter de la Court developed greenhouse horticulture near Leiden from about  Pineapple plants were distributed from the Netherlands to English gardeners in  and French ones in  In England the first pineapple was grown at Dorney Court Dorney in Buckinghamshire and a huge pineapple stove to heat the plants was built at the Chelsea Physic Garden in  In France King Louis XV was presented with a pineapple that had been grown at Versailles in  In Russia Peter the Great imported de la Court s method into St Petersburg in the s in  twenty pineapple saplings were transported from there to a greenhouse at Empress Anna s new Moscow palace  illustration of an Ananas comosus pineapple which was given the early scientific name of Cardus brasilianus folius aloes by Banhius in  Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate in greenhouses called pineries pineapple became a symbol of wealth They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties rather than being eaten and were used again and again until they began to rot In the second half of the th century the production of the fruit on British estates became the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats John Murray th Earl of Dunmore built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone cupola  metres tall in the shape of the fruit it is known as the Dunmore Pineapple In architecture pineapple figures became decorative elements symbolizing hospitality Since the th century mass commercialization Many different varieties mostly from the Antilles were tried for European glasshouse cultivation The most significant was Smooth Cayenne imported to France in  subsequently re exported to the United Kingdom in  and then from the UK via Hawaii to Australia and Africa Smooth Cayenne is now the dominant cultivar in world production Jams and sweets based on pineapple were imported to Europe from the West Indies Brazil and Mexico from an early date By the early th century fresh pineapples were transported direct from the West Indies in large enough quantities to reduce European prices Later pineapple production was dominated by the Azores for Europe and Florida and the Caribbean for North America because of the short trade routes The Spanish had introduced the pineapple into Hawaii in the th century where it is known as the hala kahiki foreign hala but the first commercial plantation was established in  The most famous investor was James Dole who moved to Hawaii in  and started a  hectare  acre pineapple plantation in  which would grow into the Dole Food Company Dole and Del Monte began growing pineapples on the island of Oahu in  and  respectively and the Maui Pineapple Company began cultivation on Maui in  James Dole began the commercial processing of pineapple and Dole employee Henry Ginaca invented an automatic peeling and coring machine in  James Drummond Dole   was the early promoter of the pineapple industry in Hawaii He founded the company now known as the Dole Food Company Del Monte pineapple fields in Bukidnon Philippines Hawaiian production started to decline from the s because of competition and the shift to refrigerated sea transport Dole ceased its cannery operations in Honolulu in  and in  Del Monte terminated its pineapple growing operations in Hawaii In  the Maui Pineapple Company reduced its operations to supply pineapples only locally on Maui and by  only the Dole Plantation on Oahu grew pineapples in a volume of about   percent of the world s production Despite this decline the pineapple is sometimes used as a symbol of Hawaii Further foods with pineapple in them are sometimes known as Hawaiian for this reason alone In the Philippines Smooth Cayenne was introduced in the early s by the US Bureau of Agriculture during the American colonial period Dole and Del Monte established plantations in the island of Mindanao in the s in the provinces of Cotabato and Bukidnon respectively Large scale canning had started in Southeast Asia including in the Philippines from  This trade was severely damaged by World War II and Hawaii dominated the international trade until the s The Philippines remain one of the top exporters of pineapples in the world The Del Monte plantations are now locally managed after Del Monte Pacific Ltd a Filipino company completed the purchase of Del Monte Foods in  Composition Nutrition Pineapple rawNutritional value per  g   oz Energy kJ  kcal

left intact ready for filling eg with other fruits Phytochemistry Pineapple fruits and peels contain diverse phytochemicals among which are polyphenols including gallic acid syringic acid vanillin ferulic acid sinapic acid coumaric acid chlorogenic acid epicatechin and arbutin Present in all parts of the pineapple plant bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes It is present in stem fruit crown core leaves of pineapple itself Bromelain is under preliminary research for treatment of a variety of clinical disorders but has not been adequately defined for its effects in the human body Bromelain may be unsafe for some users such as in pregnancy allergies or anticoagulation therapy Having sufficient bromelain content raw pineapple juice may be useful as a meat marinade and tenderizer Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products such as gelatin based desserts or gel capsules their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing Varieties Cultivars Many cultivars are known The leaves of the commonly grown smooth cayenne are smooth and it is the most commonly grown worldwide Many cultivars have become distributed from its origins in Paraguay and the southern part of Brazil and later improved stocks were introduced into the Americas the Azores Africa India Malaysia and Australia Varieties include Hilo is a compact   to   kg  to  lb Hawaiian variant of smooth cayenne the fruit is more cylindrical and produces many suckers but no slips Kona sugarloaf at   to   kg   lb

Spanish at   kg   lb has pale yellow flesh with a pleasant aroma is squarish in shape and well adapted for shipping as fresh fruit to distant markets it has spiny leaves and is grown in Latin America and the Philippines It was the original pineapple cultivar in the Philippines grown for their leaf fibers pi a in the traditional Philippine textile industry Smooth cayenne a   to   kg  to  lb pale yellow to yellow fleshed cylindrical fruit with high sugar and acid content is well adapted to canning and processing its leaves are without spines It is an ancient cultivar developed by Amerind peoples In some parts of Asia this cultivar is known as Sarawak after an area of Malaysia in which it is grown It is one of the ancestors of cultivars   also called MD  and CO  and   also called MD  Smooth cayenne was previously the variety produced in Hawaii and the most easily obtainable in U S grocery stores but was replaced over the course of the mid s and s by MD  Some Ananas species are grown as ornamentals for color novel fruit size and other aesthetic qualities In the US in  the Pineapple Research Institute was dissolved and its assets divided between Del Monte and Maui Land and Pineapple Del Monte took cultivar   dubbed MD  to its plantations in Costa Rica found it to be well suited to growing there and launched it publicly in  as Gold Extra Sweet while Del Monte also began marketing   dubbed CO  as Del Monte Gold The Maui Pineapple Company began growing variety   in  and named it Maui Gold The successor company to MPC the Hali imaile Pineapple Company continues to grow

 Costa Rica   Brazil   China   Thailand   World   Production See also List of countries by pineapple production In  world production of pineapples was  million tonnes led by Indonesia the Philippines and Costa Rica each producing about  million tonnes Uses Culinary The flesh and juice of the pineapple are used in cuisines around the world In many tropical countries pineapple is prepared and sold on roadsides as a snack It is sold whole or in halves with a stick inserted Whole cored slices with a cherry in the middle are a common garnish on hams in the West Chunks of pineapple are used in desserts such as fruit salad as well as in some savory dishes including the Hawaiian pizza or as a grilled ring on a hamburger Traditional dishes that use pineapple include hamonado afritada kaeng som pla and Hawaiian haystack Crushed pineapple is used in yogurt jam sweets and ice cream The juice of the pineapple is served as a beverage and it is also the main ingredient in cocktails such as the pi a colada and in the drink tepache In the Philippines a traditional jelly like dessert called nata de pi a has also been produced since the th century It is made by fermenting pineapple juice with the bacteria Komagataeibacter xylinus Pineapple vinegar is an ingredient found in both Honduran and Filipino cuisine where it is produced locally In Mexico it is usually made with peels from the whole fruit rather than the juice however in Taiwanese cuisine it is often produced by blending pineapple juice with grain vinegar The European Union consumed  of the global total for pineapple juice in   The Netherlands was the largest importer of pineapple juice in Europe Thailand Costa Rica and the Netherlands are the major suppliers to the European Union market in   Countries consuming the most pineapple juice in  were Thailand Indonesia and the Philippines having combined consumption of  of the world total The consumption of pineapple juice in China and India is low compared to their populations Textiles Main article Pi a The Red Spanish cultivar of pineapples were once extensively cultivated in the Philippines The long leaves of the cultivar were the source of traditional pi a fibers an adaptation of the native weaving traditions with fibers extracted from abac These were woven into lustrous lace like nipis fabrics usually decorated with intricate floral embroidery known as calado and sombrado The fabric was a luxury export from the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period and gained favor among European aristocracy in the th and th centuries Domestically they were used to make the traditional barong tagalog baro t saya and traje de mestiza clothing of the Filipino upper class as well as women s kerchiefs pa uelo They were favored for their light and breezy quality which was ideal in the hot tropical climate of the islands The industry was destroyed in the Second World War and is only starting to be revived  painting of a Filipina in traditional traje de mestiza dress Calado embroidery on a barong tagalog th century handkerchief in the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum Frock coat   Philippines Metropolitan Museum of Art Houseplant The variety A comosus Variegatus is occasionally grown as a houseplant It needs direct sunlight and thrives at temperatures of  to  C  to  F with a minimum winter temperature of  C  F It should be kept humid but the soil should be allowed to dry out between waterings It has almost no resting period but should be repotted each spring until the container reaches  centimeters  in Cultivation In commercial farming flowering can be induced artificially and the early harvesting of the main fruit can encourage the development of a second crop of smaller fruits Once removed during cleaning the top of the pineapple can be planted in soil and a new plant will grow Slips and suckers are planted commercially Storage and transport Some buyers prefer green fruit others ripened or off green A plant growth regulator Ethephon is typically sprayed onto the fruit one week before harvest developing ethylene which turns the fruit golden yellow After cleaning and slicing a pineapple is typically canned in sugar syrup with added preservative A pineapple never becomes any riper than it was when harvested Ethical and environmental concerns Like most modern fruit production pineapple plantations are highly industrialized operations In Costa Rica particularly the pineapple industry uses large amounts of insecticides to protect the crop which have caused health problems in many workers These workers often receive little compensation and are mostly poor migrants often Nicaraguan Workers wages also decrease every time prices are lowered overseas In  the government declared that it would be trying to improve the situation with the help of various other groups Historically tropical fruit agriculture such as for pineapples has been concentrated in so called banana republics Illegal drug trade Export pineapples from Costa Rica to Europe are often used as a cover for narcotrafficking and containers are impounded routinely in both locations Expansion into protected areas In Costa Rica pineapple cultivation has expanded into the Maquenque Corredor Fronterizo Barra del Colorado and Ca o Negro wildlife refuges all located in the north of the country As those are protected areas and not national parks limited and restricted sustainable activities are allowed however pineapple plantations are industrial operations and many of these do not have the proper license to operate in the protected areas or were started before either the designation of the area recent regulations or the creation of the environmental regulatory agency Setena in  The agency has registers for around   ha   sq mi of pineapple plantations operating within protected areas but satellite imagery from  reports around   ha   sq mi Pests and diseases Main article List of pineapple diseases Pineapples are subject to a variety of diseases the most serious of which is wilt disease vectored by mealybugs typically found on the surface of pineapples but possibly in the closed blossom cups Other diseases include citrus pink disease bacterial heart rot anthracnose fungal heart rot root rot black rot butt rot fruitlet core rot and yellow spot virus Pineapple pink disease not citrus pink disease is characterized by the fruit developing a brownish to black discoloration when heated during the canning process The causal agents of pink disease are the bacteria Acetobacter aceti Gluconobacter oxydans Pantoea citrea and Tatumella ptyseos Some pests that commonly affect pineapple plants are scales thrips mites mealybugs ants and symphylids Heart rot is the most serious disease affecting pineapple plants The disease is caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and P parasitica fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions Since it is difficult to treat it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide since the fungus enters through the wounds See also Food portal Big

or t m to is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum commonly known as the tomato plant The species originated in western South America Mexico and Central America The Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate from which the English word tomato derives Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs they brought the plant to Europe in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange From there the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European colonized world during the th century Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor They are consumed in diverse ways raw or cooked and in many dishes sauces salads and drinks While tomatoes are fruits botanically classified as berries they are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year Tomato plants typically grow to   meters   ft in height They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat but are cultivated as annuals Determinate or bush plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar with a range of   cm    in in width Grape tomatoes on the vine for sale at a market History Solanum lycopersicum var lycopersicum the oldest surviving tomato fruit and leaves Page from the En Tibi Herbarium  Naturalis Leiden The wild ancestor of the tomato Solanum pimpinellifolium is native to western South America These wild versions were the size of peas The first evidence of domestication points to the Aztecs and other peoples in Mesoamerica who used the fruit fresh and in their cooking The Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe where they became used in Spanish food In France Italy and northern Europe the tomato was initially grown as an ornamental plant It was regarded with suspicion as a food because botanists recognized it as a nightshade a relative of the poisonous belladonna This was exacerbated by the interaction of the tomato s acidic juice with pewter plates The leaves and fruit contain tomatine which in large quantities would be toxic However the ripe fruit contains a much lower amount of tomatine than the immature fruit Mesoamerica The exact date of domestication is unknown by  BC it was already being cultivated in southern Mexico and probably other areas  The Pueblo people are thought to have believed that those who witnessed the ingestion of tomato seeds were blessed with powers of divination The large lumpy variety of tomato a mutation from a smoother smaller fruit originated in Mesoamerica and may be the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes  The Aztecs raised several varieties of tomato with red tomatoes called xitomatl and green tomatoes physalis called tomatl tomatillo Bernardino de Sahag n reported seeing a great variety of tomatoes in the Aztec market at Tenochtitl n Mexico City large tomatoes small tomatoes leaf tomatoes sweet tomatoes large serpent tomatoes nipple shaped tomatoes and tomatoes of all colors from the brightest red to the deepest yellow Bernardino de Sahag n mentioned Aztecs cooking various sauces some with and without tomatoes of different sizes serving them in city markets foods sauces hot sauces fried olla cooked juices sauces of juices shredded with chile with squash seeds with tomatoes with smoked chile with hot chile with yellow chile with mild red chile sauce yellow chile sauce hot chile sauce with bird excrement sauce sauce of smoked chile heated bean sauce toasted beans cooked beans mushroom sauce sauce of small squash sauce of large tomatoes sauce of ordinary tomatoes sauce of various kinds of sour herbs avocado sauce Spanish distribution Spanish conquistador Hern n Cort s may have been the first to transfer a small yellow tomato to Europe after he captured the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan now Mexico City in  The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in  by Pietro Andrea Mattioli an Italian physician and botanist who suggested that a new type of eggplant had been brought to Italy that was blood red or golden color when mature and could be divided into segments and eaten like an eggplant that is cooked and seasoned with salt black pepper and oil It was not until ten years later that tomatoes were named in print by Mattioli as pomi d oro or golden apples  After the Spanish colonization of the Americas the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean They also took it to the Philippines from where it spread to southeast Asia and then the entire Asian continent The Spanish also brought the tomato to Europe It grew easily in Mediterranean climates and cultivation began in the s It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced and was certainly being used as food by the early th century in Spain China The tomato was introduced to China likely via the Philippines or Macau in the s It was given the name f nqi foreign eggplant as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from abroad but referring specifically to early introductions Italy The San Marzano is a well known plum tomato highly prized for making pizza The recorded history of tomatoes in Italy dates back to at least  October  when the house steward of Cosimo de Medici the grand duke of Tuscany wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke s Florentine estate at Torre del Gallo had arrived safely Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy For example the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they were to be sought only for their beauty and were grown only in gardens or flower beds The tomato s ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy However in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes their habit of growing to the ground suggested low status They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other fruits already available Additionally both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any other varieties In certain areas of Italy such as Florence the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late th or early th century The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in  though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources  Unique varieties were developed over the next several hundred years for uses such as dried tomatoes sauce tomatoes pizza tomatoes and tomatoes for long term storage These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name For example Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio is the hanging tomato of Vesuvius or the well known and highly prized San Marzano plum tomato grown in that region Britain Tomatoes for sale in a UK supermarket Tomatoes were not grown in England until the s One of the earliest cultivators was John Gerard a barber surgeon Gerard s Herbal published in  and largely plagiarized from continental sources is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy Nonetheless he believed it was poisonous In fact the plant and raw fruit do have low levels of tomatine but are not generally dangerous see below Gerard s views were influential and the tomato was considered unfit for eating though not necessarily poisonous for many years in Britain and its North American colonies  However by the mid th century tomatoes were widely eaten in Britain and before the end of that century the Encyclop dia Britannica stated the tomato was in daily use in soups broths and as a garnish They were not part of the average person s diet and though by  they were described as to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets and to be used by all our best cooks reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still for the singularity of their appearance while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine For example in Elizabeth Blackwell s A Curious Herbal it is described under the name Love Apple Amoris Pomum as being consumed with oil and vinegar in Italy similar to consumption of cucumbers in the UK Middle East and North Africa The tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker British consul in Aleppo c  to  Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an ingredient in a cooked dish In  it is described as only eaten in the region within the last forty years Today the tomato is a crucial and ubiquitous part of Middle Eastern cuisine served fresh in salads e g Arab salad Israeli salad Shirazi salad and Turkish salad grilled with kebabs and other dishes made into sauces and so on United States Plum cherry and grape tomato varieties The earliest reference to tomatoes being grown in British North America is from  when herbalist William Salmon reported seeing them in what is today South Carolina  They may have been introduced from the Caribbean By the mid th century they were cultivated on some Carolina plantations and probably in other parts of the Southeast as well Thomas Jefferson who ate tomatoes in Paris sent some seeds back to America  Some early American advocates of the culinary use of the tomato included Michele Felice Corn and Robert Gibbon Johnson Many Americans considered tomatoes to be poisonous at this time and in general they were grown more as ornamental plants than as food In  W H Garrison addressed the Medico Legal Society of New York stating The belief was once transmitted that the tomato was sinisterly dangerous He recalled in his youth tomatoes were dubbed love apples or wolf apples and they were shunned as globes of the devil Alexander W Livingston receives much credit for developing numerous varieties of tomato for both home and commercial gardeners Early tomato breeders included Henry Tilden in Iowa and a Dr Hand in Baltimore The U S Department of Agriculture s  yearbook declared that half of the major varieties were a result of the abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato Livingston s first breed of tomato the Paragon was introduced in  the beginning of a great tomato culture enterprise in the county In  he introduced the Acme which was said to be involved in the parentage of most of the tomatoes introduced by him and his competitors for the next twenty five years When Livingston began his attempts to develop the tomato as a commercial crop his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour uniform in size and sweet in flavor He eventually developed over seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant Today the crop is grown in every state in the Union Because of the long growing season needed for this heat loving crop several states in the US Sun Belt became major tomato producers particularly Florida and California In California tomatoes are grown under irrigation for both the fresh fruit market and for canning and processing The University of California Davis UC Davis became a major center for research on the tomato The C M Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis is a gene bank of wild relatives monogenic mutants and miscellaneous genetic stocks of tomato The center is named for the late Dr Charles M Rick a pioneer in tomato genetics research Research on processing tomatoes is also conducted by the California Tomato Research Institute in Escalon California In California growers have used a method of cultivation called dry farming especially with Early Girl tomatoes This technique encourages the plant to send roots deep to find existing moisture in soil that retains moisture such as clayey soil Modern commercial varieties Yellow cherry tomatoes The poor taste and lack of sugar in modern garden and commercial tomato varieties resulted from breeding tomatoes to ripen uniformly red This change occurred after discovery of a mutant u phenotype in the mid th century so named because the fruits ripened uniformly This was widely cross bred to produce red fruit without the typical green ring around the stem on uncross bred varieties Prior to general introduction of this trait most tomatoes produced more sugar during ripening and were sweeter and more flavorful Evidence has been found that   of the total carbon fixed in the fruit can be produced by photosynthesis in the developing fruit of the normal U phenotype The u genetic mutation encodes a factor that produces defective chloroplasts with lower density in developing fruit resulting in a lighter green colour of unripe fruit and repression of sugars accumulation in the resulting ripe fruit by   Perhaps more important than their role in photosynthesis the fruit chloroplasts are remodelled during ripening into chlorophyll free chromoplasts that synthesize and accumulate the carotenoids lycopene carotene and other metabolites that are sensory and nutritional assets of the ripe fruit The potent chloroplasts in the dark green shoulders of the U phenotype are beneficial here but have the disadvantage of leaving green shoulders near the stems of the ripe fruit and even cracked yellow shoulders apparently because of oxidative stress due to overload of the photosynthetic chain in direct sunlight at high temperatures Hence genetic design of a commercial variety that combines the advantages of types u and U requires fine tuning but may be feasible Furthermore breeders of modern tomato cultivars typically strive to produce tomato plants exhibiting improved yield shelf life size and tolerance resistance to various environmental pressures including disease However these breeding efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various tomato fruit attributes For instance linkage drag is a phenomenon that has been responsible for alterations in the metabolism of the tomato fruit Linkage drag describes the introduction of an undesired trait or allele into a plant during backcrossing This trait allele is physically linked or is very close to the desired allele along the chromosome In introducing the beneficial allele there exists a high likelihood that the poor allele is also incorporated into the plant Thus breeding efforts attempting to enhance certain traits for example larger fruit size have unintentionally altered production of chemicals associated with for instance nutritional value and flavor Breeders have turned to using wild tomato species as a source of alleles for the introduction of beneficial traits into modern tomato varieties For example wild tomato relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids which are associated with greater sugar content or resistance to diseases caused by microbes such as resistance towards the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani However this tactic has limitations for the incorporation of certain traits such as pathogen resistance can negatively impact other favorable phenotypes such as fruit production Etymology The word tomato comes from the Spanish tomate which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl pronunciation meaning swelling fruit also fat water or fat thing The native Mexican tomatillo is tomate When Aztecs started to cultivate the fruit to be larger sweeter and red they called the new variety xitomatl or jitomates pronounced plump with navel or fat water with navel The specific name lycopersicum from the  book Species Plantarum is of Greek origin lykopersikon meaning wolf peach Bangladeshi tomato Pronunciation The usual pronunciations of tomato are t me to t MAY toh usual in North American English and t m to t MAH toh usual in British English The word s dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin s  song Let s Call the Whole Thing Off You like p te to and I like p t to You like t me to and I like t m to and have become a symbol for nitpicking pronunciation disputes In this capacity it has even become an American and British slang term saying t me to t m to when presented with two choices can mean What s the difference or It s all the same to me Botany Description This section needs additional citations for verification Please help

Tomato plants are vines initially decumbent typically growing  cm  ft or more above the ground if supported although erect bush varieties have been bred generally  cm  ft  in tall or shorter Indeterminate types are tender perennials dying annually in temperate climates they are originally native to tropical highlands although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases Determinate types are annual in all climates Tomato plants are dicots and grow as a series of branching stems with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing When the tip eventually stops growing whether because of pruning or flowering lateral buds take over and grow into other fully functional vines An unripe tomato growing on the vine Tomato vines are typically pubescent meaning covered with fine short hairs The hairs facilitate the vining process turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture especially if the vine s connection to its original root has been damaged or severed Most tomato plants have compound leaves and are called regular leaf RL plants but some cultivars have simple leaves known as potato leaf PL style because of their resemblance to that particular relative Of RL plants there are variations such as rugose leaves which are deeply grooved and variegated angora leaves which have additional colors where a genetic mutation causes chlorophyll to be excluded from some portions of the leaves The leaves are   cm   in long odd pinnate with five to nine leaflets on petioles each leaflet up to  cm  in long with a serrated margin both the stem and leaves are densely glandular hairy Their flowers appearing on the apical meristem have the anthers fused along the edges forming a column surrounding the pistil s style Flowers in domestic cultivars can be self fertilizing The flowers are   cm     in across yellow with five pointed lobes on the corolla they are borne in a cyme of three to  together Although in culinary terms tomato is regarded as a vegetable its fruit is classified botanically as a berry As a true fruit it develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization its flesh comprising the pericarp walls The fruit contains hollow spaces full of seeds and moisture called locular cavities These vary among cultivated species according to type Some smaller varieties have two cavities globe shaped varieties typically have three to five beefsteak tomatoes have a great number of smaller cavities while paste tomatoes have very few very small cavities For propagation the seeds need to come from a mature fruit and must be lightly fermented to remove the gelatinous outer coating and then dried before use Classification In  Linnaeus placed the tomato in the genus Solanum alongside the potato as Solanum lycopersicum In  Philip Miller moved it to its own genus naming it Lycopersicon esculentum The name came into wide use but was technically in breach of the plant naming rules because Linnaeus s species name lycopersicum still had priority Although the name Lycopersicum lycopersicum was suggested by Karsten  it is not used because it violates the International Code of Nomenclature barring the use of tautonyms in botanical nomenclature The corrected name Lycopersicon lycopersicum Nicolson  was technically valid because Miller s genus name and Linnaeus s species name differ in exact spelling but since Lycopersicon esculentum has become so well known it was officially listed as a nomen conservandum in  and would be the correct name for the tomato in classifications which do not place the tomato in the genus Solanum Genetic evidence has now shown that Linnaeus was correct to put the tomato in the genus Solanum making Solanum lycopersicum the correct name Both names however will probably be found in the literature for some time Two of the major reasons for considering the genera separate are the leaf structure tomato leaves are markedly different from any other Solanum and the biochemistry many of the alkaloids common to other Solanum species are conspicuously absent from the tomato On the other hand hybrids of tomato and diploid potato can be created in the lab by somatic fusion and are partially fertile providing evidence of the close relationship between these species Genetics and genetic modification Genome An international consortium of researchers from  countries began sequencing the tomato genome in  A prerelease version of the genome was made available in December  The complete genome for the cultivar Heinz  was published on  May  in Nature The latest reference genome published in  had  MB and encodes   predicted proteins spread over  chromosomes Genetic modification Main article Genetically modified tomato Since many other fruits like strawberries apples melons and bananas share the same characteristics and genes researchers stated the published genome could help to improve food quality food security and reduce costs of all of these fruits The first commercially available genetically modified food was a tomato called Flavr Savr which was engineered to have a longer shelf life However it is no longer commercially available Scientists are continuing to develop tomatoes with new traits not found in natural crops such as increased resistance to pests or environmental stresses or better flavor Breeding This section does not

The Tomato Genetic Resource Center Germplasm Resources Information Network AVRDC and numerous seed banks around the world store seed representing genetic variations of value to modern agriculture These seed stocks are available for legitimate breeding and research efforts While individual breeding efforts can produce useful results the bulk of tomato breeding work is at universities and major agriculture related corporations These efforts have resulted in significant regionally adapted breeding lines and hybrids such as the Mountain series from North Carolina Corporations including Heinz Monsanto BHNSeed and Bejoseed have breeding programs that attempt to improve production size shape color flavor disease tolerance pest tolerance nutritional value and numerous other traits Fruit versus vegetable See also Vegetable Terminology Tomatoes are considered a fruit or vegetable depending on context According to Encyclopedia Britannica tomatoes are a fruit labeled in grocery stores as a vegetable due to their taste and culinary purposes Botanically a tomato is a fruit a berry consisting of the ovary together with its seeds of a flowering plant However the tomato is considered a culinary vegetable because it has a much lower sugar content than culinary fruits because it is more savoury umami than sweet it is typically served as part of a salad or main course of a meal rather than as a dessert Tomatoes are not the only food source with this ambiguity bell peppers cucumbers green beans aubergines eggplants avocados and squashes of all kinds such as courgettes zucchini and pumpkins are all botanically fruit yet cooked as vegetables The confusion on whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables has led to legal dispute in the United States In  U S tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables but not on fruit caused the tomato s status to become a matter of legal importance In Nix v Hedden the U S Supreme Court settled the tariff controversy on  May  by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use they are generally served with dinner and not dessert The holding of this case applies only to the interpretation of the Tariff of  and the court did not purport to reclassify the tomato for botanical or other purposes Cultivation The tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits with thousands of cultivars A fertilizer with an NPK ratio of    is often sold as tomato fertilizer or vegetable fertilizer although manure and compost are also used On average there are   seeds in a pound of tomato seeds Diseases For a more comprehensive list see List of tomato diseases Tomato fruitworm feeding on unripe tomato Tomato bug feeding on tomato plant sap A split heirloom tomato caused by fluctuation in water availability Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants Various forms of mildew and blight are common tomato afflictions which is why tomato cultivars are often marked with a combination of letters that refer to specific disease resistance The most common letters are LB late blight V verticillium wilt F fusarium wilt strain I FF fusarium wilt strain I and II N nematodes T tobacco mosaic virus and A alternaria A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants Another particularly dreaded disease is curly top carried by the beet leafhopper which interrupts the lifecycle As the name implies it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally Bacterial wilt is another common disease impacting yield Wang et al  found phage combination therapies to reduce the impact of bacterial wilt sometimes by reducing bacterial abundance and sometimes by selecting for resistant but slow growing genetics Pests Some common tomato pests are the tomato bug stink bugs cutworms tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms aphids cabbage loopers whiteflies tomato fruitworms flea beetles red spider mite slugs and Colorado potato beetles The tomato russet mite Aculops lycopersici feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves flowers and fruit possibly killing the plant After an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin a plant peptide hormone Systemin activates defensive mechanisms such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects The hormone was first identified in tomatoes but similar proteins have been identified in other species since Other disorders Although not a disease as such irregular supplies of water can cause growing or ripening fruit to split Besides cosmetic damage the splits may allow decay to start although growing fruits have some ability to heal after a split In addition a deformity called cat facing can be caused by pests temperature stress or poor soil conditions Affected fruit usually remains edible but its appearance may be unsightly Companion plants See also List of companion plants and List of beneficial weeds Tomatoes serve or are served by a large variety of companion plants The devastating tomato hornworm has a major predator in various parasitic wasps whose larvae devour the hornworm but whose adult form drinks nectar from tiny flowered plants like umbellifers Several species of umbellifer are therefore often grown with tomato plants including parsley Queen Anne s lace and occasionally dill These also attract predatory flies that attack various tomato pests Borage is thought to repel the tomato hornworm moth Basil is popularly recommended as a companion plant to the tomato Common claims are that basil may deter pests or improve tomato flavor However in double blind taste tests basil did not significantly affect the taste of tomatoes when planted adjacent to them Tomato plants can protect asparagus from asparagus beetles because they contain solanine that kills this pest while asparagus plants contain asparagusic acid that repels nematodes known to attack tomato plants Marigolds also repel nematodes Pollination Tomato flower in full bloom next to a young green developing fruit Flowers and ripe fruit can be present simultaneously In the wild original state tomatoes required cross pollination they were much more self incompatible than domestic cultivars As a floral device to reduce selfing the pistil of wild tomatoes extends farther out of the flower than today s cultivars The stamens were and remain entirely within the closed corolla As tomatoes were moved from their native areas their traditional pollinators probably a species of halictid bee did not move with them The trait of self fertility became an advantage and domestic cultivars of tomato have been selected to maximize this trait This is not the same as self pollination despite the common claim that tomatoes do so That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in greenhouse situations where pollination must be aided by artificial wind vibration of the plants one brand of vibrator is a wand called an electric bee that is used manually or more often today by cultured bumblebees The anther of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube with the pollen produced within the structure rather than on the surface as in most species The pollen moves through pores in the anther but very little pollen is shed without some kind of externally induced motion The ideal vibratory frequencies to release pollen grains are provided by an insect such as a bumblebee or the original wild halictid pollinator capable of engaging in a behavior known as buzz pollination which honey bees cannot perform In an outdoors setting wind or animals usually provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops Fruit formation Pollination and fruit formation depend on meiosis Meiosis is central to the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule fertilization can occur either by self or cross pollination Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit Homologs of the recA gene including rad play a key role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during meiosis A rad homolog is present in the anther of tomato Lycopersicon esculentum suggesting that recombinational repair occurs during meiosis in tomato Hydroponic and greenhouse cultivation Hydroponic cultivation Greenhouse cultivation in Andalusia Tomatoes are often grown in greenhouses in cooler climates and cultivars such as the British Moneymaker and a number of cultivars grown in Siberia are specifically bred for indoor growing In more temperate climates it is not uncommon to start seeds in greenhouses during the late winter for future transplant Greenhouse tomato production in large acreage commercial greenhouses and owner operator stand alone or multiple bay greenhouses is on the increase providing fruit during those times of the year when field grown fruit is not readily available Smaller sized fruit cherry and grape or cluster tomatoes fruit on the vine are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner operator growers Hydroponic technique is often used in hostile growing environments as well as high density plantings Picking and ripening To facilitate transportation and storage tomatoes are often picked unripe green and ripened in storage with ethylene A machine harvestable variety of tomato the square tomato was developed in the s by University of California Davis s Gordie C Hanna which in combination with the development of a suitable harvester revolutionized the tomato growing industry This type of tomato is grown commercially near plants that process and can tomatoes tomato sauce and tomato paste They are harvested when ripe and are flavorful when picked They are harvested  hours a day seven days a week during a  to  week season and immediately transported to packing plants which operate on the same schedule California is a center of this sort of commercial tomato production and produces about a third of the processed tomatoes produced in the world In  Calgene introduced a genetically modified tomato called the FlavrSavr which could be vine ripened without compromising shelf life However the product was not commercially successful and was sold only until  Yield The world dedicated   million hectares in  for tomato cultivation and the total production was about   million tonnes The average world farm yield for tomato was   tonnes per hectare in  Tomato farms in the Netherlands were the most productive in  with a nationwide average of  tonnes per hectare followed by Belgium  tonnes per hectare and Iceland  tonnes per hectare Records The tomato tree as seen by guests on the Living with the Land boat ride at Epcot Lake Buena Vista Florida As of  the heaviest tomato harvested weighed

Nutriculture Ltd UK of Mawdesley Lancashire UK in  A massive tomato tree growing inside the Walt Disney World Resort s experimental greenhouses in Lake Buena Vista Florida may have been the largest single tomato plant in the world The plant has been recognized as a Guinness World Record Holder with a harvest of more than   tomatoes and a total weight of  kg   lb It yielded thousands of tomatoes at one time from a single vine Yong Huang Epcot s manager of agricultural science discovered the unique plant in Beijing China Huang brought its seeds to Epcot and created the specialized greenhouse for the fruit to grow The vine grew golf ball sized tomatoes which were served at Walt Disney World restaurants The tree developed a disease and was removed in April  after about  months of life

production of tomatoes was  million tonnes with China accounting for  of the total followed by India the European Union Turkey and the United States as major producers see table Toxicity The leaves stem and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the alkaloid tomatine whose effect on humans has not been studied They also contain small amounts of solanine a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family However solanine concentrations in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed for example as greens Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect and the green fruit of unripe red tomato varieties is sometimes used for cooking particularly as fried green tomatoes There are also tomato varieties with fully ripe fruit that is still green Compared to potatoes the amount of solanine in unripe green or fully ripe tomatoes is low However even in the case of potatoes while solanine poisoning resulting from dosages several times the normal human consumption has been demonstrated actual cases of poisoning from excessive consumption of potatoes are rare Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit or chew plant material Salmonella Tomatoes were linked to seven Salmonella outbreaks between  and  and may have been the cause of a salmonellosis outbreak causing  illnesses in  US states in  The  United States salmonellosis outbreak caused the temporary removal of tomatoes from stores and restaurants across the United States and parts of Canada although other foods including jalape o and serrano peppers may have been involved Uses Culinary Tomatoes stuffed with hard boiled egg and Parmesan cheese Though it is botanically a berry a subset of fruit the tomato is considered a vegetable for culinary purposes It has a strong savoury umami flavour rather than significant sweetness see above Chef Heston Blumenthal observed that the inner pulp had more flavour that the flesh a subsequent academic study in which he participated confirmed that the pulp had up to eleven times more glutamic acid which carries umami flavour than the flesh Although tomatoes originated in the Americas the tomato is now grown and eaten around the world It is used in diverse ways including raw in salads or in slices stewed incorporated into a wide variety of dishes or processed into ketchup or tomato soup Unripe green tomatoes can also be breaded and fried used to make salsa or pickled Tomato juice is sold as a drink and is used in cocktails such as the Bloody Mary Tomatoes have become extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine as a key ingredient in pizza and many pasta sauces Tomatoes are also used in Spanish and Catalan dishes such as gazpacho and pa amb tom quet Storage Tomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight It is not recommended to refrigerate them as they take a mealy texture and lose flavour Storing stem down can prolong shelf life as it may keep from rotting too quickly Unripe tomatoes can be kept in a paper bag to ripen Tomatoes are easy to preserve whole chopped or as tomato sauce or concentrated paste by home canning The fruit can also be preserved by drying sometimes in the sun where climate permits and sold either in bags or in jars with oil

thinners and similar medications The review concludes that the synergistic effects of all tomato constituents are likely to outweigh the benefits of tomato s individual constituents such as lycopene Studies in  and  did not find conclusive evidence to indicate that the lycopene in tomatoes or in supplements affects the onset of cardiovascular diseases or cancer In the United States supposed health benefits of consuming tomatoes tomato products or lycopene to affect cancer cannot be mentioned on packaged food products without a qualified health claim statement In a scientific review of potential claims for lycopene favorably affecting DNA skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation heart function and vision the European Food Safety Authority concluded in  that the evidence for lycopene having any of these effects was inconclusive Host plant The potato tuber moth Phthorimaea operculella is an oligophagous insect that prefers to feed on plants of the family Solanaceae such as tomato plants Female P operculella use the leaves to lay their eggs and the hatched larvae will eat away at the mesophyll of the leaf Tomato forms a mutually beneficial symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi such as Rhizophagus irregularis Scientists use tomato as a model species for investigating this symbiosis In popular culture The town of Bu ol Spain annually celebrates La Tomatina a festival centered on an enormous tomato fight On  August    Spaniards gathered to throw   kg   lb of tomatoes at each other in the festival Tomatoes thrown from a truck during the Spanish Tomatina festival Several US states have adopted the tomato as a state fruit or vegetable see above Tomatoes have been designated the state vegetable of New Jersey Arkansas took both sides by declaring the South Arkansas Vine Ripe Pink Tomato both the state fruit and the state vegetable in the same law citing both its culinary and botanical classifications In  the state of Ohio passed a law making the tomato the state s official fruit Tomato juice has been the official beverage of Ohio since  Alexander W Livingston of Reynoldsburg Ohio played a large part in popularizing the tomato in the late th century his efforts are commemorated in Reynoldsburg with an annual Tomato Festival Flavr Savr was the first commercially grown genetically engineered food licensed for human consumption Tomatkarnevalen The Tomato Festival in N rpes Finland in  Tomatoes are a popular nonlethal throwing weapon in mass protests and there was a common tradition of throwing rotten tomatoes at bad performers on a stage during the th century today this is usually referenced as a metaphor Embracing it for this protest connotation the Dutch Socialist party adopted the tomato as their logo The US city of Reynoldsburg Ohio calls itself The Birthplace of the Tomato claiming the first commercial variety of tomato was bred there in the th century Rotten Tomatoes is an American review aggregation website for film and

generally usedCheese rice lettuce guacamole salsa sour creamVariationsBreakfast burrito Mission burrito Cookbook Burrito Media Burrito A burrito English b ri to Spanish in Mexico is historically a regional name among others for what is known as a taco a tortilla filled with food in other parts of the country In modern times it is considered by many as a different dish in Mexican and Tex Mex cuisine that took form in Ciudad Ju rez consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it make it more pliable and allow it to adhere to itself Burritos are often eaten by hand as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together Burritos can also be served wet i e covered in a savory and spicy sauce when they would be eaten with a fork and knife Burritos are filled with savory ingredients most often a meat such as beef chicken or pork and often include other ingredients such as rice cooked beans either whole or refried vegetables such as lettuce and tomatoes cheese and condiments such as salsa pico de gallo guacamole or crema Burritos are often contrasted in present times with similar dishes such as tacos in which a small hand sized tortilla is folded in half around the ingredients rather than wrapped and sealed or with enchiladas which use corn masa tortillas and are covered in a savory sauce to be eaten with a fork and knife Etymology The word burrito means little donkey in Spanish the diminutive form of burro or donkey The name burrito as applied to the dish possibly derives from the tendency for burritos to contain a lot of different things similar to how a donkey would be able to carry a large burden History A basic burrito that has not been fully wrapped with meat refried beans sauce and cheese Before the development of the modern burrito the Maya civilization of Mexico used corn tortillas as early as  B C to wrap foods with fillings of chili peppers tomatoes mushrooms squash and avocados Historically the Pueblo peoples of the Southwestern US also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito But these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco rather than the modern burrito The precise origin of the modern burrito is not known but there is evidence that in Mexico burrito was just another name among others for a taco a rolled tortilla whether corn or wheat filled with meat or other ingredients In the  Diccionario de Mejicanismos by Feliz Ramos i Duarte burrito was identified as the regional name given in the Mexican state of Guanajuato to what is known as a taco in other regions Tortilla arrollada con carne u otra cosa dentro que en Yucat n llaman co ito y en Cuernavaca y en Mexico taco A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside called co ito in Yucat n and taco in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City In his Diccionario de Mejicanismos  Mexican linguist and philologist Francisco J Santamar a identifies burrito as another name for a taco in the state of Guerrero while in the State of Sinaloa it s specifically a taco filled with salt En el Estado de Guerrero taco en el sentido de tortilla arrollada con comida adentro En Yucatan le llaman coorto En Sinaloa taco de tortilla con sal In the State of Guerrero taco in the sense of a rolled tortilla with food inside In Yucatan they call it coorto In Sinaloa a tortilla taco with salt The Dictionary of Mexican Spanish Diccionario del Espa ol de M xico by the Colegio de M xico also provides those definitions stating that it s a regionalism from both the states of Guerrero and Michoac n for tacos and also states that in the state of Sinaloa it s a taco de sal salt taco a rolled corn tortilla with salt in it In her book Life in Mexico  Scottish noblewoman Frances Erskine Inglis states that the term burro was the name given to a corn tortilla filled with cheese the gentlemen from Morelia suffering for their politeness in having escorted us the two damsels of the bath naiads of the boiling spring pitying our hungry condition came to offer their services one asked me if I should like to eat a burro in the mean time A burro being an ass I was rather startled at the proposition and assured her that I should infinitely prefer waiting a little longer before resorting to so desperate a measure Some people call them pecadoras female sinners said her sister Upon this the gentlemen came to our assistance and burros or pecadoras were ordered forthwith They proved to be hot tortillas with cheese in them and we found them particularly good Being that burrito was originally just a regional name for what is known as a taco or codzito in other regions of Mexico the use of both corn and wheat flour tortillas was understandable In fact references to burritos made with corn tortillas appear as late as  in California Ana B gu de Packman author of the book Early California Hospitality  wrote that corn and flour tortillas could be used interchangeably for making burritos In modern day Mexico wheat flour tortilla burritos are known as tacos de harina wheat flour tacos in Central and Southern Mexico Folk History Some have speculated that it may have originated with vaqueros the cowboys of northern Mexico in the th century An often repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named Juan M ndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Ju rez during the Mexican Revolution period   while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food To keep the food warm M ndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a small tablecloth As the food of the burrito i e food of the little donkey grew in popularity burrito was eventually adopted as the name for these large tacos Another origin story tells of Ciudad Ju rez in the s where a street food vendor created the tortilla wrapped food to sell to poor children at a state run middle school The vendor would call the children his burritos because burro is a colloquial term for a dunce or dullard Eventually the somewhat derogatory but endearing term for the children was transferred to the food that they ate In  Alejandro Borquez opened the Sonora Cafe in Los Angeles that later changed its name to El Cholo Spanish Cafe Burritos first appeared on American restaurant menus at the El Cholo Spanish Cafe in Los Angeles during the s Burritos were mentioned in the U S media for the first time in  appearing in the Mexican Cookbook a collection of regional recipes from New Mexico that was written by historian Erna Fergusson In  a frozen burrito was developed in Southern California  Development of regional varieties Mexico Burritos are a traditional food of Ciudad Ju rez a city bordering El Paso Texas in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua where people buy them at restaurants and roadside stands Northern Mexican border towns like Villa Ahumada have an established reputation for serving burritos Authentic Mexican burritos are usually small and thin with flour tortillas containing only one or two of several ingredients either some form of meat or fish potato rice beans asadero cheese chile rajas or chile relleno Other ingredients may include barbacoa mole refried beans and cheese a bean and cheese burrito or deshebrada shredded slow cooked flank steak The deshebrada burrito has a variation with chile colorado mild to moderately hot and one with salsa verde very hot The Mexican burrito may be a northern variation of the traditional taco de Canasta which is eaten for breakfast lunch and dinner Although burritos are one of the most popular examples of Mexican cuisine outside of Mexico they are only popular in the northern part of Mexico However they are beginning to appear in some nontraditional venues in other parts of Mexico Wheat flour tortillas used in burritos are now often seen throughout much of Mexico possibly due to these areas being less than optimal for growing maize or corn despite at one time being particular to northwestern Mexico the Southwestern US Mexican American community and Pueblo Indian tribes Burritos are commonly called tacos de harina wheat flour tacos in Central Mexico and Southern Mexico and burritas the feminine variation with a in northern style restaurants outside of northern Mexico proper A long and thin fried burrito called a chivichanga which is similar to a chimichanga is prepared in the state of Sonora and vicinity A variation of the burrito found in the Mexican state of Sonora is known as the burro percher n San Francisco Mission burrito Main article Mission burrito Mission style burrito containing shredded pork beans and rice The origins of the Mission burrito or Mission style burrito can be traced back to San Francisco in the Mission District taquer as of the s and s This type of burrito is produced on a steam table assembly line and is characterized by a large stuffed flour tortilla wrapped in aluminum foil and may include fillings such as carne asada beef Mexican style rice whole beans not refritos sour cream and onion Febronio Ontiveros claims to have offered the first retail burrito in San Francisco in  at El Faro The Lighthouse a corner grocery store on Folsom Street Ontiveros claims credit for inventing the super burrito a style which may have led to the early development of the San Francisco style This innovative style involves the addition of rice sour cream and guacamole to the standard burrito of meat beans and cheese The Mission burrito emerged as a regional culinary movement during the s and s The popularity of San Francisco style burritos has grown locally at Mission Street taquerias like El Farolito and nationally at chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Illegal Pete s Chevy s Fresh Mex Freebirds World Burrito Qdoba and Barberitos Chili s had a brief stint with Fresh Mex foods and burritos between  and  In  World Wrapps opened in San Francisco s Marina District and brought a burrito inspired wrap style to the restaurant industry San Diego Contents of a carne asada burrito San Diego style burritos include California burritos and carne asada burritos The style has been described by food writers as an austere meal of meat cheese and salsa a contrast to the Mission style burrito which is typically larger and always contains more ingredients A significant subgroup of Mexican restaurants in San Diego serves burritos described as no frills and in contrast to Mission style burritos the assembly line is not used  In the early s Roberto Robledo opened a tortilleria in San Diego and learned the restaurant business Robledo began selling small bean burritos or burrititos at La Lomita in the late s and by  he had established the first Roberto s Taco Shop By  Roberto s restaurants had expanded to a chain of  taco shops offering fresh burritos known for their distinctive quality Hoping to draw on the prestige of Roberto s new taco shops in San Diego began using the bertos suffix with names like Alberto s Filiberto s Hilberto s and others   Contents of a California burrito The California burrito originated at an unknown berto s named restaurant in San Diego in the s   The Fresh MXN chain formerly Santana s also claimed to be the originator of the California burrito The earliest known published mention was in a  article in the Albuquerque Tribune The California burrito typically consists of chunks of carne asada meat French fries cheese and either cilantro pico de gallo sour cream onion or guacamole or some combination of these five  The ingredients are similar to those used in the carne asada fries dish and it is considered a staple of the local cuisine of San Diego With the merging of French fries and more traditional burrito fillings the California burrito is an example of fusion border food The California burrito has also been described as a trans class food item as it is regularly consumed by people across socioeconomic lines Variants of this burrito may add shrimp surf and turf or substitute carnitas pork or chicken for carne asada The carne asada burrito is considered one of the regional foods of San Diego Carolynn Carreno has said that to San Diegans carne asada burritos are as integral to the experience of the place as a slice of pizza pie is to a New Yorker The San Diego style carne asada burrito is served with chunks of carne asada guacamole and pico de gallo salsa This wall to wall use of meat contrasts to burrito styles that use rice and beans as filler ingredients Los Angeles A chile relleno burrito wrapped in yellow paper from Al and Bea s in the Boyle Heights neighborhood in Los Angeles Los Angeles also has several unique local burrito varieties The first is the most traditional and is exemplified by the versions at Mexican American restaurants such as Al Bea s Lupe s  and Burrito King These restaurants have often been in existence for decades and they offer a distinctly Americanized menu compared with the typical taqueria The burrito of L A itself can take multiple forms but is almost always dominated by some combination of refried beans meat often stewed beef or chili and cheese usually cheddar with rice and other ingredients typical of Mission burritos offered as add ons if at all The most basic version of this burrito consists of only beans and cheese beyond this there are the green chile and red chile burritos which may simply mean the addition of chiles or a meatless chile sauce to the plain beans as at Al Bea s meat or cheese as well Rice again is rarely included which along with the choice of chiles is one of the style s most defining traits The menu will then usually go on to list multiple other combinations such as beef and bean all beef a special with further ingredients etc If the restaurant also offers hamburgers and sandwiches it may sell a burrito version of these such as a hot dog burrito In addition to the version described Los Angeles is also home to three burrito styles that can be said to fall under the category of Mexican fusion cuisine The first is the famed kosher burrito served since  at its eponymous restaurant at st Street and Main in Downtown Los Angeles Another is the Korean kogi burrito invented by American chef Roy Choi the first to combine Mexican and Korean cuisines The kogi burrito was named the seventh best burrito in Los Angeles in  by the LA Weekly The kogi burrito is accented with chile soy vinaigrette sesame oil and fresh lime juice Food writer Cathy Chaplin has said that this is what Los Angeles tastes like Finally there is the sushi burrito most notably the version sold at the Jogasaki food truck Wrapped in flour tortillas sushi burritos include such fillings as spicy tuna tempura and cucumber The existence of such a large truly Mexican community in Los Angeles also makes it possible to find a variety of authentic burrito dishes from different regions of Mexico from Oaxaca to Hidalgo Variations and similar dishes A wet burrito is covered with a red chili sauce similar to a red enchilada sauce with melted shredded cheese on top It is usually eaten from a plate using a knife and fork rather than eaten with the hands This variety is sometimes called smothered enchilada style mojado Spanish for wet or suizo Swiss used in Spanish to indicate dishes topped with cheese or cream The Beltline Bar in Grand Rapids Michigan is said to have introduced the wet burrito in  A burrito bowl is not technically a burrito despite its name as it consists of burrito fillings served without the tortilla The fillings are placed in a bowl and a layer of rice is put at the bottom In  a Meal Ready to Eat version of a burrito bowl was introduced It is not to be confused with a taco salad which has a foundation of lettuce inside a fried tortilla tostada A breakfast burrito is composed of breakfast foods from American cuisine particularly scrambled eggs wrapped in a flour tortilla This style was invented and popularized in several regional American cuisines most notably New Mexican cuisine Southwestern cuisine Californian cuisine and Tex Mex A chimichanga is a deep fried burrito popular in Southwestern and Tex Mex cuisines and in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora A taco is similar to a burrito but is served open rather than closed is generally smaller and is often made with corn tortillas rather than wheat tortillas The taco editor of Texas Monthly argues that burritos are a type of taco D r m is a Turkish wrap that is usually filled with typical doner kebab ingredients Gallery A wet burrito A steak burrito bowl A chorizo and egg breakfast burrito with salsa A chimichanga Research Taco Bell research chef Anne Albertine experimented with grilling burritos to enhance portability This grilling technique allowed large burritos to remain sealed without spilling their contents This is a well known cooking technique used by some San Francisco taquerias and Northern Mexican burrito stands Traditionally grilled burritos are cooked on a comal griddle Bean burritos which are high in protein

carne asada and al pastor As is traditional they are garnished simply with cilantro fresh coriander and chopped onion and served with lime on the side for seasoning according to the diner s taste TypeFinger foodPlace of originMexicoMain ingredients Tortilla Protein animal or vegetable Ingredients generally used Vegetables Cheese Sauces Media Taco A taco US t ko UK t ko Spanish is a traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand sized corn or wheat based tortilla topped with a filling The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand A taco can be made with a variety of fillings including beef pork chicken seafood beans vegetables and cheese and garnished with various condiments such as salsa guacamole or sour cream and vegetables such as lettuce onion tomatoes and chiles Tacos are a common form of antojitos or Mexican street food which have spread around the world Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as burritos which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded taquitos which are rolled and fried or chalupas tostadas in which the tortilla is fried before filling Etymology The origins of the taco are not precisely known and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical Taco in the sense of a typical Mexican dish comprising a maize tortilla folded around food is just one of the meanings connoted by the word according to the Real Academia Espa ola publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua Espa ola This meaning of the Spanish word taco is a Mexican innovation but the word taco is used in other contexts to mean wedge wad plug billiard cue blowpipe ramrod short stocky person short thick piece of wood The etymological origin of this sense of the word is Germanic and has cognates in other European languages including the French word tache and the English word tack In Spain the word taco can also be used in the context of tacos de jam n these are diced pieces of ham or sometimes bits and shavings of ham leftover after a larger piece is sliced They can be served on their own as tapas or street food or can be added to other dishes such as salmorejo omelettes stews empanadas or mel n con jam n According to one etymological theory the culinary origin of the term taco in Mexico can be traced to its employment among Mexican silver miners as a term signifying plug The miners used explosive charges in plug form consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling Indigenous origins are also proposed One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word tlahco meaning half or in the middle in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla Furthermore dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre Columbian society for example the Nahuatl word tlaxcalli a type of corn tortilla History There is significant debate about the origins of the taco in Mexico with some arguing that the taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico since there is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors Bernal D az del Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans a meal which Hern n Cort s arranged for his captains in Coyoac n Others argue that the advent of the taco is much more recent with one of the more popular theories being that the taco was invented by silver miners in the th century One of the oldest mentions of a taco comes from an  cookbook Nuevo y sencillo arte de cocina reposteria y refrescos by Antonia Carrillo in a recipe for a rolled pork loin lomo de cerdo enrollado she instructs the readers to roll the loin like they would a taco de tortilla or tortilla taco Another mention of the word taco comes from the novel El hombre de la situaci n  by Mexican writer Manuel Payno They surrounded the father s bed and he putting a pillow on his legs which served as a table began to give the example and a pleasant gathering was formed which was completed by the mother who always entered last waving with one hand from right to left a large cup of white atole while with the other she carried right to her mouth a tortilla taco filled with a spread of red chile These instances predate the theory that the first mention of the word taco in Mexico was in the  novel Los bandidos de R o Fr o by Manuel Payno Traditional variations There are many traditional varieties of tacos Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat Tacos al pastor shepherd style or tacos de adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame broiled as it spins Tacos de asador spit or grill tacos may be composed of any of the following carne asada tacos tacos de tripita tripe tacos grilled until crisp and chorizo asado traditional Spanish style sausage Each type is served on two overlapped small tortillas and sometimes garnished with guacamole salsa onions and cilantro coriander leaf Also prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called mulita little mule made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with Oaxaca style cheese Mulita is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico while they are known as gringas in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas Tacos may also be served with salsa Tacos de cabeza head tacos in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow These include Cabeza a serving of the muscles of the head Sesos brains Lengua tongue Cachete cheeks Trompa lips and Ojo eye Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency These tacos are typically served in pairs and also include salsa onion and cilantro coriander leaf with occasional use of guacamole Tacos de camarones shrimp

where they consist of grilled or fried fish lettuce or cabbage pico de gallo and a sour cream or citrus mayonnaise sauce all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla In the United States they were first popularized by the Rubio s fast food chain and remain most popular in California Colorado and Washington In California they are often found at street vendors and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top Tacos dorados fried tacos literally golden tacos called flautas flute because of the shape or taquitos for which the tortillas are filled with pre cooked shredded chicken beef or barbacoa rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep fried until crisp They are sometimes cooked in a microwave oven or broiled Tacos sudados sweaty tacos are made by filling

Hard shell tacos are sometimes known as tacos dorados golden tacos in Spanish a name that they share with taquitos Various sources credit different individuals with the invention of the hard shell taco but some form of the dish likely predates all of them Beginning from the early part of the twentieth century various types of tacos became popular in the country especially in Texas and California but also elsewhere By the late s companies like Ashley Mexican Food and Absolute Mexican Foods were selling appliances and ingredients for cooking hard shell tacos and the first patents for hard shell taco cooking appliances were filed in the s In the mid s Glen Bell opened Taco Tia and began selling a simplified version of the tacos being sold by Mexican restaurants in San Bernardino

Indian tacos or Navajo tacos are made using frybread instead of tortillas They are commonly eaten at pow wows festivals and other gatherings by and for indigenous people in the United States and Canada This kind of taco is not known to have been present before the arrival of Europeans in what is now the Southwestern United States Navajo tradition indicates that frybread came into use in the s

Flag Great Seal Monuments Motto Anthem Bird World Heritage Sites United States portalvte American cuisine consists of the cooking style and traditional dishes prepared in the United States It has been significantly influenced by Europeans Indigenous Americans Africans Latin Americans Asians Pacific Islanders and many other cultures and traditions Principal influences on American cuisine are European Native American soul food regional heritages including Cajun Louisiana Creole Pennsylvania Dutch Mormon foodways Texan Tex Mex New Mexican and Tlingit and the cuisines of immigrant groups such as Chinese American Italian American Jewish American Greek American and Mexican American The large size of America and its long history of immigration have created an especially diverse cuisine that varies by region American cooking dates back to the traditions of the Native Americans whose diet included a mix of farmed and hunted food and varied widely across the continent The Colonial period created a mix of new world and Old World cookery and brought with it new crops and livestock During the early th century cooking was based mostly on what the agrarian population could grow hunt or raise on their land With an increasing influx of immigrants and a move to city life American food further diversified in the later part of the th century The th century saw a revolution in cooking as new technologies the World Wars a scientific understanding of food and continued immigration combined to create a wide range of new foods This has allowed for the current rich diversity in food dishes throughout the country This was driven in part by the many chefs and television personalities who contributed to the rise of the culinary arts in the US Highlights of American cuisine include milkshakes barbecue and a wide range of fried foods Many quintessential American dishes are unique takes on food originally from other culinary traditions including pizza hot dogs and Tex Mex Regional highlights include a range of fish dishes in the coastal states gumbo and cheesesteak American cuisine has specific foods that are eaten on holidays such as a turkey at thanksgiving dinner or Christmas dinner Modern American cuisine includes a focus on fast food as well as take out food which is often ethnic There is also a vibrant culinary scene in the country surrounding televised celebrity chefs History Native Americans origins American cuisine before  See also Native American cuisine Diorama of Iroquois planting the Three Sister crops squash maize and climbing beans Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American cuisine that have been blended with the methods of early Europeans to form the basis of what is now American cuisine Nearly all regions and subregions of the present day cuisine have roots in the foodways of Native Americans who lived in tribes numbering in the thousands Prior to  native peoples lived off the land in very diverse bioregions and had done so for thousands of years often living a nomadic life where their diet changed with the season Many practiced a form of agriculture revolving around the Three Sisters the rotation of beans maize and squash as staples of their diet In the East this was documented as early as the s in Of Plimoth Plantation evidenced by the pages William Bradford wrote regarding Squanto who showed them the traditional regional method of burying a fish or eel in a mound with seeds for maize to improve the soil this itself is also part of the widely practiced phenomenon of companion planting Wild game was equally a staple of nearly every tribe generally deer elk and bison were staples as were rabbits and hare The Cherokee of the Southern Appalachians used blowguns made of an indigenous type of bamboo to hunt squirrels Northern tribes like the Ojibwe of what is now the state of Michigan and the peoples of the Wabanaki of what is now the state of Maine would stalk and hunt moose whereas their Southern counterparts like the Choctaw or Catawba hunted snapping turtles and other testudines possums and young alligators in the subtropical swamps of Louisiana and South Carolina Many tribes would preserve their meat in the form of pemmican needed on long journeys or to survive harsh winters Fish and crustaceans Blue crab was used on the eastern and southern coast of what is now the U S mainland As with the hunted game the biome in which one lived often dictated what was available to catch For example the Apache and Navajo peoples of the Southwest whose territories each would have included swathes of New Mexico and Arizona generally do not eat fish because in both cultures it is taboo as well as often inconvenient The Navajo believe that fish have a part in the story of creation the Apache were in general afraid of water since they associated it with thunder and the arid desert climate made fish a rarity However in the culture of the Lenape the tribe that originally lived in New Jersey on the Delaware River and the area that now comprises New York City fish and shellfish were a staple in their diet and it was such a revered part of the culture that there is a documented and still practiced harvest dance called the Fish Dance Originally it would have been done to celebrate bringing in fish from places like the Delaware or Raritan River or the estuary around Manhattan Island and the completion of smoking them as a source of food for the winter ahead Eastern tribes would have eaten cod particularly groups that spoke the Algonquian languages of New England as far south as present day Connecticut winter flounder and other flatfish species of herring like the alewife shad Atlantic herring and Atlantic menhaden They also would have consumed the Atlantic sturgeon and drum In the West Pacific several species of sturgeon like the white sturgeon and green sturgeon olachen and several autochthonal fish of the Oncorhynchus family including the rainbow trout cutthroat trout coho salmon kokanee salmon and chinook salmon The last makes an appearance in the accounts of Lewis and Clark as being fished for in the Columbia River Basin and this species is named for a family of tribes of the Pacific Northwest indicating its important role in that food culture Pacific gray whales and humpbacks were hunted by American Indians off the Northwest coast especially by the Makah and used for their meat and oil Catfish was also popular among native people throughout the land over many types of terrain Crustaceans included shrimp lobster crayfish and dungeness crabs in the Northwest and shrimp lobster and blue crabs in the East Other shellfish include abalone and geoduck on the West Coast while on the East Coast the surf clam quahog and the soft shell clam Oysters were eaten on both shores as were mussels and periwinkles Cooking methods Early American natives used a number of cooking methods that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of American cuisine Grilling meats was common Spit roasting over a pit fire was common as well Vegetables especially root vegetables were often cooked directly in the ashes of the fire As early Native Americans lacked pottery that could be used directly over a fire they developed a technique many anthropologists call stone boiling They heated rocks in a fire then added the rocks to a pot filled with water until it came to a boil to cook the meat or vegetables In what is now the Southwestern United States they also created adobe ovens dubbed hornos by the Spanish to bake products such as cornmeal bread Other parts of America dug pit ovens which were also used to steam foods by adding heated rocks or embers One technique performed extensively by New England tribes was adding seaweed or corn husks on top of the layers of stones to steam fish and shellfish as well as vegetables A later addition was potatoes a garden plant that came to New England by the th century added while still in skin with corn in husk later to be referred to as a clambake by colonists Colonial period Main article Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies Roast turkey with gravy cranberry sauce mashed potatoes green beans sweet and sour cod steamed rice achara pickled green papaya relish leche flan pig in a blanket and apple crisp Map of the  American Colonies in  The European settlement of the Americas introduced a number of ingredients spices herbs and cooking styles to the continent When European colonists came to Virginia Pennsylvania Massachusetts and any of the other English colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America their initial attempts at survival included planting crops familiar to them from back home in England In the same way they farmed animals for clothing and meat Through hardships and the eventual establishment of trade with England the West Indies and other regions the colonists were able to derive a cuisine similar to what they had previously consumed in Britain and Ireland while also introducing local animals and plants to their diet American colonists followed along the line of British cookery up until the Revolution when a desire to distinguish themselves from Britain led Americans to create American styles of cookery In  the first American cookbook was published and others followed There was a general disdain for French cuisine French cookery even with French Huguenot settlers in South Carolina and French Canadian emigrants in America One of the cookbooks that proliferated in the colonies was The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy  by Hannah Glasse who referred to the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby than give encouragement to a good English cook Of the French recipes given in the text she speaks out flagrantly against the dishes as she think it an odd jumble of trash With the introduction of slavery Africans were brought into the colonies With them came foods and ingredients such as bananas peanuts sweet potato yams and coffee and cooking styles reminiscent of West African cuisines are still found in many dishes especially in Southern cuisine The expulsion of the Acadians from Acadia led many of them to Louisiana where they left a French influence in the diet of those settled in Louisiana and among the Acadian Francophones who settled eastern Maine and parts of what is now northern Vermont at the same time they colonized New Brunswick Some of the Jews who fled from the Inquisition with other Sephardic Jews in the th century had previously settled in Recife Brazil and the West Indies where their cuisine was influenced by new local ingredients like molasses rum sugar vanilla chocolate peppers corn tomatoes kidney beans string beans and turkey In  twenty three Sephardic Jews arrived in New Amsterdam bringing this cuisine with them to the early colonial United States Early American Jewish cuisine was heavily influenced by this branch of Sephardic cuisine Many of the recipes were bound up in observance of traditional holidays and remained true to their origins These included dishes such as stew and fish fried in olive oil beef and bean stews almond puddings and egg custards The first kosher cookbook in America was the Jewish Cookery Book by Esther Levy published in  in Philadelphia and includes many of the traditional recipes Common ingredients A New England clam bake consists of various steamed shellfish The American colonial diet varied depending on the settled region in which someone lived Local cuisine patterns had been established by the mid th century The New England colonies were extremely similar in their dietary habits to those that many of them had brought from England As many of the New Englanders were originally from England game hunting was useful when they immigrated to the New World Many of the northern colonists depended upon their ability to hunt or upon others from whom they could purchase game Hunting was the preferred method of protein acquisition as opposed to animal husbandry which required much more work to defend the kept animals against raids A striking difference for the colonists in New England compared to other regions was seasonality While in the southern colonies they could farm almost year round in the northern colonies the growing seasons were very restricted In addition northern colonists close proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to add to their diet Wheat the grain used to bake bread back in England was almost impossible to grow and imports of wheat were far from cost productive Substitutes in cases such as this included cornmeal The Johnnycake was a poor substitute to some for wheaten bread but acceptance by both the northern and southern colonies seems evident Livestock and game Commonly hunted game included deer bear buffalo and wild turkey The larger muscles of the animals were roasted and served with currant sauce while the other smaller portions went into soups stews sausages pies and pastries In addition to the game colonists protein intake was supplemented by mutton The Spanish in Florida originally introduced sheep to the New World but this development never quite reached the North and there they were introduced by the Dutch and English The keeping of sheep was a result of the English non practice of animal husbandry The animals provided wool when young and mutton upon maturity after wool production was no longer desirable The forage based diet for sheep that prevailed in the Colonies produced a characteristically strong gamy flavor and a tougher consistency which required aging and slow cooking to tenderize Fats and oils A plate of scrapple a traditional dish of the Delaware Valley region made of pork and cornmeal still eaten today Fats and oils made from animals served to cook many colonial foods Many homes had a sack made of deerskin filled with bear oil for cooking while solidified bear fat resembled shortening Rendered pork fat made the most popular cooking medium especially from the cooking of bacon Pork fat was used more often in the southern colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs earlier to the South The colonists enjoyed butter in cooking as well but it was rare prior to the American Revolution as cattle were not yet plentiful Alcoholic drinks Prior to the Revolution New Englanders consumed large quantities of rum and beer as maritime trade provided them relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as the main ingredient molasses was readily available from trade with the West Indies Further into the interior however one would often find colonists consuming whiskey as they did not have similar access to sugar cane They did have ready access to corn and rye which they used to produce their whiskey Until the Revolution many considered whiskey to be a coarse alcohol unfit for human consumption as many believed that it caused the poor to become raucous and unkempt drunkards In addition to these alcohol based products produced in America imports were seen on merchant shelves including wine and brandy Southern variations In comparison to the northern colonies the southern colonies were quite diverse in their agricultural diet The uplands of Piedmont and the coastal lowlands made up the two main parts of the southern colonies The diet of the uplands often included wild game cabbage string beans corn squashes and white potatoes People had biscuits as part of their breakfast along with healthy portions of pork The lowlands of Louisiana included a varied diet heavily influenced by the French Spanish Acadians Germans Native Americans Africans and Caribbeans Rice played a large part of the diet in Louisiana In addition unlike the uplands the lowlands subsistence of protein came mostly from coastal seafood Much of the diet involved the use of peppers as it still does to this day Post colonial cuisine During the th and th centuries Americans developed many new foods Some such as Rocky Mountain oysters stayed regional some spread throughout the nation but with little international appeal such as peanut butter a core ingredient of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich and some spread throughout the world such as popcorn cola fried chicken cornbread unleavened muffins such as the poppyseed muffin and brownies th century American farmhouse During the s American farms were mostly self sufficient but certain staples like salt coffee sugar and baking soda would be purchased at the town general store If the family did not grow wheat then flour would also be purchased Another luxury was canned salmon which was sometimes eaten for Sunday dinner Items purchased at the general store would be paid for with eggs butter or some other food from the farm Women were responsible for much of the processing of food like straining fresh milk churning butter making molasses from sorghum grinding corn into cornmeal or cleaning whole chickens Fresh picked apples were pressed into cider which could be fermented to make apple cider vinegar Fruits and vegetables were preserved by various means like canning drying or pickling One contemporary writer from Michigan described October as cider season when apple butter would be made Her writings mention johnnycakes and as winter fare buckwheat cakes Typical farmhouse fare included fried chicken simmered green beans boiled corn chicken and dumplings fried ham boiled beans and beets stewed tomatoes potatoes and coleslaw made of shredded cabbage Pon haus similar to the scrapple of the Pennsylvania Dutch was a typical breakfast dish among the Germans who had settled Indiana in the th century Pork scraps and corn meal were cooked into a thick porridge and molded in loaf pans Once solidified the mixture would be cut and fried During the fall months pork might be replaced with fried apples or potatoes It was served with buttered biscuits jam jelly milk gravy or sorghum syrup Fruit butter might be made from apples plums or peaches to accompany the meal A whole new class of city dwellers harried worried furtive hungry looking people have come into being in the wake of the kitchenette and no modern influence has had so great a part in affecting the morals health and spiritual well being of a generation as has this ill shapen ill planned adjunct of modern living Jane Pride New York Herald th century The th century revolutionized American cooking with the advent of many new technologies and a continued influx of immigrants with unique food traditions Pre World War I At the universities nutritionists and home economists taught a new scientific approach to food In the early s muckraking journalists raised public concern about the wholesomeness of industrialized food products that contained various preservatives and adulterants of unknown safety From  to  Harvey Washington Wiley a chemist at the U S Department of Agriculture supervised hygienic table trials to test the safety of food additives and preservatives His work contributed to the enactment of the Pure Food and Drug Act of  He became the first commissioner of the FDA and later led the laboratories of Good Housekeeping Magazine During World War I the Progressives moral advice about food conservation was emphasized in large scale state and federal programs designed to educate housewives Large scale foreign aid during and after the war brought American standards to Europe From  to the end of the s researchers discovered and popularized the role of various vitamins and minerals in human health Starting with iodized salt in  commercially distributed food began to be fortified with vitamins and minerals In  milk began to be fortified with viosterol a purified vitamin D product Synthetic thiamin vitamin B first became available after  and bakers began voluntarily enriching bread with high vitamin yeast or synthetic vitamins in the late s The cookware of the period was made of cast iron and these were thoroughly seasoned with pork fat Fried salt pork with gravy was an indulgent fat laden dish often served with a side of boiled potatoes In the Appalachian region a dish called killed lettuce was made with pokeweed dandelion and assorted wild greens that were drizzled with hot bacon grease until wilted or killed Pie could be served up to three times a day and many varieties were prepared depending on the season During the spring months pies would be made of rhubarb and strawberry in summer peach cherry blackberry blueberry elderberry and grape and in fall apple The staples of the urban diet were bread dairy and canned goods Dinner might be tomato bisque from a can topped with cream or a salad made of canned string beans and mayonnaise Many preferred to purchase food at delicatessens rather than attempt to prepare meals in the cramped kitchenettes German delicatessens in cities like New York and Milwaukee sold imported cold cuts potato salads schmierkase wienerwurst North Sea herring assorted pickles pickled cucumber and other prepared foods Jewish immigrants from Germany soon followed suit replacing pork dishes with corned beef salt cured beef and pastrami Ice cream soda was served at soda fountains along with various other early soda water recipes like the Garden Sass Sundae rhubarb or the Oh Oh Cindy Sundae strawberry ice cream topped with chocolate syrup chopped nuts whipped cream and candied cherries During that same time frame grain feeding of cattle during low pasture months made milk increasingly available year round The invention of milking machines lowered production costs Pasteurization homogenization evaporation condensation and refrigeration along with glass milk bottles wax paper cartons and then plastic bottles made milk increasingly available and safe for urban consumers Milk became a staple food item and an increasingly important ingredient in American cuisine Examples include the root beer float and the milkshake Pork was a staple of the rural diet through the Southern and Midwestern United States Lard was used for baking frying and even as a seasoning A strawberry and a chocolate shake each topped with whipped cream sprinkles and a maraschino cherry Major railroads featured upscale cuisine in their dining cars Restaurant chains emerged with standardized decor and menus including the Fred Harvey restaurants along the route of the Santa Fe Railroad in the Southwest World War II and later The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Science established the first set of Recommended Dietary Allowances in  In  the US War Foods Administration issued the War Food Order No  which made enriched bread the temporary law of the land In  George Stigler published an article on The cost of subsistence which described the so called Stigler diet his solution to the problem of providing a diet that met the RDA at a minimum cost The logistical requirements of the US military during WW and the Korean War spurred the development and growth of the processed foods industry in the US These wars encouraged the production of shelf stable ingredients processed on a vast industrial scale Examples include powdered milk powdered eggs potato flakes and frozen concentrated orange juice After the war low cost highly processed foods became one of the foundational elements of an era of mass prosperity Many companies in the American food industry developed new products requiring minimal preparation such as frozen entrees One such example is the TV dinner in which a multi course meal was assembled in aluminum packaging in a food factory and flash frozen then reheated at home in a thermal oven to be served while watching TV Convenience foods of the era were designed to simplify home preparation One example is macaroni cheese created using a powdered artificial cheese product that is reconstituted at home with fresh milk Newspapers and magazines ran recipe columns aided by research from corporate kitchens which were major food manufacturers like General Mills Campbell s and Kraft Foods For example General Mills Betty Crocker s Cookbook first published in  was a popular book in American homes Highly processed foods of the mid th century included novelty elements like multi colored Jell O using various chemical food colorings prepared breakfast cereals marketed to children with large amounts of sugar and artificial colors e g Froot Loops Fruit flavored punches made with artificial fruit flavorings e g Tang Hi C Mid th century foods also added novelty packaging elements like spray cheese in an aerosol can pimento stuffed olives and drink pouches The development of the microwave oven resulted in the creation of industrial food products and packaging intended to take advantage of the opportunities and overcome the unique challenges of that technology Microwave popcorn is an example of such a product Throughout the second half of the th century the US commercial food system has become increasingly dependent on subsidized maize corn production to provide feed for livestock and ingredients for human foods such as high fructose corn syrup It is estimated that the typical American gets  percent of their carbon intake from maize corn sources The last half of the th century saw the development of controversial technological innovations intended to lower the cost of improve the quality of or increase the safety of commercial food including food irradiation genetically modified organisms livestock treated with antibiotics hormones and concentrated animal feeding operations Activists have raised concerns about the wholesomeness safety or humaneness of these innovations and recommend alternatives such as organic produce veganism vegetarianism and locavore diets Fast food restaurants with standardized product and franchised service models began to appear and spread with the development of the highway system White Castle  was one of the first examples Franchising was introduced in  by A W Root Beer The McDonald brothers created their Speedee Service System in  Other examples include Burger King KFC Wendy s Pizza Hut Little Caesars Domino s Pizza and Papa John s Pizza Ethnic influences A cheeseburger served with fries and coleslaw One signature characteristic of American cooking is the fusion of multiple ethnic or regional approaches into completely new cooking styles For example spaghetti is Italian while hot dogs are German a popular meal especially among young children is spaghetti containing slices of hot dogs Since the s Asian cooking has played a particularly large role in American fusion cuisine Eggs Benedict an American breakfast dish made with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce served in this variation with smoked salmon Some dishes that are typically considered American have their origins in other countries American cooks and chefs have substantially altered these dishes over the years to the degree that the dishes now enjoyed around the world are considered to be American Hot dogs and hamburgers are both based on traditional German dishes but in their modern popular form they can be reasonably considered American dishes Pizza is based on the traditional Italian dish brought by Italian immigrants to the United States but varies highly in style based on the region of development since its arrival For example Chicago style has focus on a thicker taller crust whereas a New York Slice is known to have a much thinner crust which can be folded These different types of pizza can be advertised throughout the country and are generally recognizable and well known with some restaurants going so far as to import New York tap water from a thousand or more miles away to recreate the signature style in other regions Some dishes that Americans think of as being of foreign in origin and or associated with a particular immigrant group were in fact invented in America and customized to American tastes For example General Tso s chicken was invented by Chinese or Taiwanese chefs working in New York in the early s The dish is unknown in China except for a distant resemblance to a much spicier dish from Hong Kong said to have influenced the American version The fortune cookie was likewise invented in California in the early s and is known in Asia only as an American style food A modern dish consisting of traditional roasted turkey sweet potatoes and grilled vegetables prepared with modern fusion ingredients A wave of celebrity chefs began with Julia Child and Graham Kerr in the s with many more following after the rise of cable channels like Food Network Probably the best known television chef was Child who taught French cuisine in her weekly show The French Chef By the beginning of the st century regional variations in consumption of meat began to reduce as more meat was consumed overall Saying they eat too much protein the   Dietary Guidelines for Americans asked men and teenage boys to increase their consumption of underconsumed foods such as vegetables New American Main article New American cuisine During the s upscale restaurants introduced a mixing of cuisines that contain Americanized styles of cooking with foreign elements commonly referred to as New American cuisine a type of fusion cuisine combining flavors from the melting pot of traditional American cooking techniques with those from other cultures sometimes adding molecular

traces its roots to English cuisine and the Native American cuisine of the Abenaki Narragansett Niantic Wabanaki Wampanoag and other native peoples It also includes influences from French Italian and Portuguese cuisine among others It is characterized by the extensive use of potatoes beans dairy products and seafood Corn historically the main crop grown by Native American tribes in New England continues to be grown in all New England states It is traditionally used in hasty pudding cornbread and corn chowder Three prominent foodstuffs native to New England are maple syrup cranberries and blueberries Maine is the only state with a commercial wild blueberry industry with  million pounds harvested in  Initial European colonists came from East Anglia in England East Anglian cookery included dishes like suet puddings soda breads and a few shellfish delicacies and would have been quite simple in contrast to the dishes prepared in contemporary London Most of this cuisine was one pot cookery which developed into such dishes as succotash chowder baked beans and others The most popular starches in New England cuisine include potatoes and cornmeal and a few native breads like Anadama bread johnnycakes bulkie rolls Parker House rolls popovers ployes and New England brown bread Because of the influence of New Englander health reformers the most well known of whom is Sylvester Graham this region is fairly conservative with its spices but typical spices include nutmeg ginger cinnamon cloves and allspice especially in desserts and for savory foods thyme black pepper sea salt and sage Typical condiments include maple syrup grown from the native sugar maple molasses and cranberry sauce The fruits of the region include the Vitis labrusca grapes used in grape juice made by companies such as Welch s along with jelly Kosher wine by companies like Mogen David and Manischewitz along with other wineries that make higher quality wines Though not anywhere near as productive a region as the top three apple producing regions apples have been a staple of New England foodways since at least the s and it is here that a very high amount of heirloom varieties are found many of them gaining renewed interest as part of locavore movements and the re emergence of cider as a beverage of choice Apples from New England would include varieties imported from their earliest in Europe and a few natives like Baldwin Lady Mother Pomme Grise Porter Roxbury Russet Rhode Island Greening Sops of Wine Hightop Sweet Peck s Pleasant Titus Pippin Westfield Seek No Further and Duchess of Oldenburg Beach plums a small native species with fruits the size of a pinball are sought after in summer to make into a jam Cranberries are another fruit indigenous to the region often collected in autumn in huge flooded bogs Thereafter they are juiced so they can be drunk fresh for breakfast or dried and incorporated into salads and quickbreads Winter squashes like pumpkin and butternut squashes have been a staple for generations owing to their ability to keep for long periods over icy New England winters and being an excellent source of beta carotene in summer they are replaced with pattypan and zucchini the latter brought to the region by immigrants from Southern Italy a century ago Blueberries are a very common summertime treat owing to them being an important crop and find their way into muffins pies and pancakes Historically New England and the other original  colonies were major producers of hard cider and the only reason why this changed were that immigrants from Western and Central Europe preferred beer especially lagers to apple based alcohol In more recent years cider has made a roaring comeback nationwide with New England being the first to break out of the box and with many pomologists scouring the woods for abandoned apple trees and heirloom varieties to add to the cider press Angry Orchard is a local commercial brand that began in New Hampshire but has since skyrocketed in sales with other large marques following suit around the land Typical favorite desserts are quite diverse and encompass hasty pudding blueberry pie whoopie pies Boston cream pie pumpkin pie Joe Frogger cookies hand crafted ice cream Hermit cookies and the chocolate chip cookie invented in Massachusetts in the s New England is noted for having a heavy emphasis on seafood a legacy inherited from coastal tribes like the Wampanoag and Narragansett who equally used the rich fishing banks offshore for sustenance Favorite fish include cod salmon winter flounder haddock striped bass pollock hake bluefish and in southern New England tautog All of these are prepared numerous ways such as frying cod for fish fingers grilling bluefish over hot coals for summertime smoking salmon or serving a whole poached one chilled for feasts with a dill sauce or on cold winter nights serving haddock baked in casserole dish with a creamy sauce and crumbled breadcrumbs as a top so it forms a crust Clam cakes a savory fritter based on chopped clams are a specialty of Rhode Island Also a hard shell clam is unique to Rhode Island called the Quahoag which is used in clear chowders Farther inland brook trout largemouth bass and herring are sought after especially in the rivers and icy finger lakes in upper New England where New Englanders will fly fish for them in summertime Meat is present though not as prominent and typically is either stewed in dishes like Yankee pot roast and New England boiled dinner or braised as in a picnic ham these dishes suit the weather better as summers are humid and hot but winters are raw and cold getting below  C for most of the winter and only just above it by March The roasting of whole turkeys began here as a centerpiece for large American banquets and like all other East Coast tribes the Native American tribes of New England prized wild turkeys as a source of sustenance and later Anglophone settlers were enamored of cooking them using methods they knew from Europe often that meant trussing the bird and spinning it on a string or spit roasting Today turkey meat is a key ingredient in soups and also a favorite in several sandwiches like the Pilgrim For lunch hot roast beef is sometimes chopped finely into small pieces and put on a roll with salami and American or provolone cheese to make a steak bomb Bacon is often maple cured and often bacon or salt pork drippings are an ingredient in corn chowder a cousin of clam chowder Veal consumption was prevalent in the North Atlantic States prior to World War II A variety of lingui a is favored as a breakfast food introduced by Portuguese fishermen and Brazilian immigrants Dairy farming and its resultant products figure strongly on the ingredient list and homemade ice cream is a summertime staple of the region it was a small seasonal roadside stand in Vermont that eventually became the internationally famous Ben and Jerry s ice cream Vermont is known for producing farmhouse style cheeses especially a type of cheddar The recipe goes all the way back to colonial times when English settlers brought the recipe with them from England and found the rocky landscape eminently suitable to making the cheese Today Vermont has more artisanal cheese makers per capita than any other state and diversity is such that interest in goat s milk cheeses has become prominent Crustaceans and mollusks are also an essential ingredient in the regional cookery Maine and Massachusetts in more recent years have taken to harvesting peekytoe crab and Jonah crab and making crab bisques based on cream with  milkfat and crabcakes out of them often these were overlooked as bycatch of lobster pots by fishermen of the region but in the past  years their popularity has firmly established them as a staple They even appear on the menu as far south as to be out of the region in New York where they are sold to four star restaurants in the form of cocktail claws Whelks are eaten in salad and lobster which is indigenous to the coastal waters of the region and are a feature of many dishes baked boiled roasted and steamed or simply eaten as a sandwich chilled with mayonnaise and chopped celery in Maine and Massachusetts or slathered with melted butter on Long Island and in Connecticut Shellfish of all sorts are part of the diet and shellfish of the coastal regions include little neck clams sea scallops blue mussels oysters soft shell clams and razor shell clams Much of this shellfish contributes to New England tradition the clambake The clambake as known today is a colonial interpretation of an American Indian tradition In summer oysters and clams are dipped in batter and fried often served in a basket with french fries or commonly on a wheaten bun as a clam roll Oysters are otherwise eaten chilled on a bed of crushed ice on the half shell with mignonette sauce and are often branded on where they were harvested Large quahogs are stuffed with breadcrumbs and seasoning and baked in their shells and smaller ones often find their way into clam chowder Other preparations include clams casino clams on the half shell served stuffed with herbs like oregano and streaky bacon Southern New England particularly along the coast shares many specialties with the Mid Atlantic including especially dishes from Jewish and Italian American cuisine Coastal Connecticut is known for distinctive kinds of pizza locally called apizza pronounced locally as abeetz differing in texture thin and slightly blackened and toppings such as clams from

Cuisine of Philadelphia Cuisine of New York City and Cuisine of the Mid Atlantic United States New York strip steak topped with mushrooms and onions The mid Atlantic states comprise the states of New York New Jersey Delaware Pennsylvania and Northern Maryland The oldest major settlement in this area of the country is found in the most populous city in the nation New York founded in  by the Dutch Today it is a major cultural capital of the United States The influences on cuisine in this region are extremely eclectic owing to the fact that it has been and continues to be a gateway for international culture as well as a gateway for new immigrants Going back to colonial times each new group has left their mark on homegrown cuisine and in turn the cities in this region disperse trends to the wider United States In addition cities like New York and Philadelphia have had the past influence of Dutch Italian German Irish British and Jewish cuisines and that continues to this day Baltimore has become the crossroads between North and South a distinction it has held since the end of the Civil War A global power city New York is well known for its diverse and cosmopolitan dining scene Its restaurants compete fiercely for good reviews in the Food and Dining section of The New York Times online guides and Zagat s the last of which is widely considered the premier American dining guide published yearly and headquartered in New York New York style cheesecake with strawberries Other variations include blueberry or raspberry sauce Many of the more complicated dishes with rich ingredients like Lobster Newberg waldorf salad vichyssoise eggs benedict and the New York strip steak were born out of a need to entertain and impress the well to do in expensive bygone restaurants like Delmonico s and still standing establishments like the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Modern commercial American cream cheese was developed in  Since the first reference to an alcoholic mixed drink called a cocktail comes from New York State in  it is not a surprise that there have been many cocktails invented in New York and the surrounding environs Even today New York bars are noted for being highly influential in making national trends Cosmopolitans Long Island iced teas Manhattans Rob Roys Tom Collins Aviations and Greyhounds were all invented in New York bars and the gin martini was popularized in New York in speakeasies during the s as evidenced by its appearance in the works of New Yorker and American writer F Scott Fitzgerald Like its neighbor Philadelphia many rare and unusual liquors and liqueurs often find their way into a mixologist s cupboard or restaurant wine list New York State is the third most productive area in the country for wine grapes just behind California and Washington It has AVA s near the Finger Lakes the Catskills and Long Island and in the Hudson Valley has the second most productive area in the country for growing apples making it a center for hard cider production just like New England Pennsylvania has been growing rye since Germans began to emigrate to the area at the end of the th century and required a grain they knew from Germany Therefore overall it is not unusual to find New York grown Gew rtztraminer and Riesling Pennsylvania rye whiskey or marques of locally produced ciders like Original Sin on the same menu Philadelphia cheesesteak with Cheez Whiz Since their formative years New York Philadelphia and Baltimore have welcomed immigrants of every kind to their shores and all three have been an important gateway through which new citizens to the general United States arrive Traditionally natives have eaten cheek to jowl with newcomers for centuries as the newcomers would open new restaurants and small businesses and all the different groups would interact Even in colonial days this region was a very diverse mosaic of peoples as settlers from Switzerland Wales England Ulster Wallonia Holland Gelderland the British Channel Islands and Sweden sought their fortune in this region This is very evident in many signature dishes and local foods all of which have evolved to become American dishes in their own right The original Dutch settlers of New York brought recipes they knew and understood from the Netherlands and their mark on local cuisine is still apparent today in many quarters of New York their version of apple pie with a streusel top is still baked In the colony of New Amsterdam their predilection for waffles in time evolved into the American national recipe and forms part of a New York brunch They also made coleslaw originally a Dutch salad but today accented with the later th century introduction of mayonnaise The doughnut began its life originally as a New York pastry that arrived in the th century as the Dutch olykoek with later additions from other nations of Europe like the Italian zeppole the Jewish Polish p czki and the German Berliner arriving in the th century to complete the variety found in modern doughnuts today Crab cake popular in Maryland Delaware and New Jersey is often served on a roll Crab cakes were once a kind of English croquette but over time as spices have been added they and the Maryland crab feast became two of Baltimore s signature dishes Fishing for blue crab is a favorite summer pastime in the waters off Maryland New Jersey and Delaware where they may grace the table at summer picnics Other mainstays of the region have been present since the early years of American history like oysters from Cape May the Chesapeake Bay and Long Island and lobster and tuna from the coastal waters found in New York and New Jersey Philadelphia Pepper Pot a tripe stew was originally a British dish but today is a classic of home cooking in Pennsylvania alongside bookbinder soup a type of turtle soup In the winter New York pushcarts sell roasted chestnuts a delicacy dating back to English Christmas traditions and it was in New York and Pennsylvania that the earliest Christmas cookies were introduced Germans introduced crunchy molasses based gingerbread and sugar cookies in Pennsylvania and the Dutch introduced cinnamon based cookies all of which have become part of the traditional Christmas meal Scrapple was originally a type of savory pudding that early Pennsylvania Germans made to preserve the offal of a pig slaughter The Philadelphia soft pretzel was originally brought to Eastern Pennsylvania in the early th century and later th century immigrants sold them to the masses from pushcarts to make them the city s best known bread product having evolved into its own unique recipe New York style pizza is the pizza eaten in New York New Jersey and Connecticut After the s new groups began to arrive and the character of the region began to change There had been some Irish from Ulster prior to  however largely they had been Protestants with somewhat different culture and often a different language than the explosion of emigrants that came to Castle Garden and Locust Point in Baltimore in their masses starting in the s The Irish arrived in America in a rather woeful state as Ireland at the time was often plagued by some of the worst poverty in Europe and often heavy disenfranchisement among the masses Many of them arrived barely alive having ridden coffin ships to the New World very sick with typhus and gaunt from prolonged starvation In addition they were the first to face challenges other groups did not have they were the first large wave of Catholics They faced prejudice for their faith and the cities of Philadelphia New York and Baltimore were not always set up for their needs For example Catholic bishops in the U S mandated until the s that all Catholics were forbidden from eating red meat on Fridays and during Lent and attending Mass sometimes conflicted with work as produce and meat markets would be open on high holy days this was difficult for Irishmen supporting families since many worked as laborers Unsurprisingly many Irishmen also found their fortunes working as longshoremen which would have given their families access to fish and shellfish whenever a fisherman made berth which was frequent on the busy docks of Baltimore and New York Though there had been some activity in Baltimore in founding a see earlier by the Carrolls the Irish were the first major wave of Catholic worship in this region and that meant bishops and cardinals sending away to Europe for wine Wine with water is consecrated as part of the Catholic Mass Taverns had existed prior to their emigration to America in the region though the Irish brought their particular brand of pub culture and founded some of the first saloons and bars that served Dublin style stout and red ale they brought with them the knowledge of single malt style whiskey and sold it The Irish were the first immigrant group to arrive in this region in massive millions and these immigrants also founded some of the earliest saloons and bars in this region of which McSorley s is a still operating example Philadelphia style soft pretzel It was also in this region that the Irish introduced something that today is a very important festival in American culture that involves a large amount of food drink and merry making Halloween In England and Wales where prior immigrants had come from the feast of All Hallows Eve had died out in the Reformation dismissed as superstition and excess having nothing to do with the Bible and often replaced with the festival of Guy Fawkes Night Other immigrant groups like the Germans preferred to celebrate October  as Reformation Day and after the American Revolution all of the above were less and less eager to celebrate the legacy of an English festival given they had fought against Great Britain for their independence The Catholicism of the Irish demanded attendance at church on November  and charity and deeds not just faith as a cornerstone of dogma and many of their older traditions survived the Reformation and traveled with them Naturally they went door to door to collect victuals for masked parties as well as gave them out like nuts to roast on the fire whiskey beer or cider and barmbracks they also bobbed for apples and made dumb cakes Later in the century they were joined by Scots going guising children going door to door to ask for sweets and treats in costume From the Mid Atlantic this trend spread to be nationwide and evolved into American children trick or treating on October  wearing costumes and their older counterparts having wild costume parties with various foods and drinks such as caramel apples candy apples dirt cakes punch cocktails cider both alcoholic and non pumpkin pie candy corn chocolate turtles peanut brittle taffy tipsy cake and copious buckets full of candy children carving jack o lanterns and eating squash derived foods derive from Halloween s heritage as a harvest festival and from Irish and Scottish traditions of carving turnips and eating root vegetables at this time of year Bobbing for apples has survived to the present day as a Halloween party classic game as has a variation on the parlor game of trying to grab an apple hanging from the ceiling blindfolded it has evolved into trying to catch a donut in one s teeth Immigrants from Southern Europe namely Sicily Campania Lazio and Calabria appeared between  and  in New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Eastern Maryland hoping to escape the extreme poverty and corruption endemic to Italy Typically none of them spoke English but rather dialects of Italian and had a culture that was more closely tied to the village they were born in than the high culture only accessible to those who could afford it at this time many could not read or write in any language They were employed in manual labor or factory work but it is because of them that dishes like spaghetti with meatballs New York style pizza calzones and baked ziti exist and Americans of today are very familiar with semolina based pasta noodles Their native cuisine had less of an emphasis on meat as evidenced by dishes they introduced like pasta e fagioli and minestrone but the dishes they created in America often piled it on as a sign of wealth and newfound prosperity since for the first time even cheap cuts of it were affordable The American recipe for lasagna is proof of this as mostly it is derived from the Neapolitan version of the dish with large amounts of meat and cheese Carts selling frankfurters the predecessor to hotdogs in New York circa  The price is listed as  cents each or  for  cents New York style hot dogs came about with German speaking emigrants from Austria and Germany particularly with the frankfurter sausage and the smaller wiener sausage Jews would also contribute here by introducing the kosher version of these sausages made of beef rather than pork Today the New York style hot dog with sauerkraut mustard and the optional cucumber pickle relish is such a part of the local fabric that it is one of the favorite comestibles of New York and both the pork and the beef versions are beloved Hot dogs are a typical street food sold year round in all but the most inclement weather from thousands of pushcarts As with all other stadiums in Major League Baseball they are an essential for New York Yankees and the New York Mets games though it is the local style of preparation that predominates without exception Hot dogs are also the focus of a televised eating contest on the Fourth of July in Coney Island at Nathan s Famous one of the earliest hot dog stands opened in the United States in  by Nathan Handwerker Handwerker was a Jewish man who emigrated from what is now Ukraine in  and whose influence is felt today around the world Coney Island is most famous for being a traditional boardwalk amusement park and the site of the world s first rollercoaster a precursor of modern theme parks Hot dogs are a staple of amusement parks  years later A summertime treat Italian ice began its life as a sweeter adaptation of the Sicilian granita that was strictly lemon flavored and brought to New York and Philadelphia Its Hispanic counterpart piragua is a common shaved ice treat brought to New York by Puerto Ricans in the s Unlike the original dish which included flavors like tamarind mango coconut piragua is evolving to include flavors like grape and cherry fruits which are impossible to grow in the tropical Puerto Rican climate and get exported back to the island from New York Taylor Ham a meat delicacy of New Jersey first appeared around the time of the Civil War and today is often served for breakfast with eggs and cheese on a kaiser roll a variant of a roll brought to the area by Austrians in the second half of the th century now commonly used for sandwiches at lunchtime often topped with poppyseeds This breakfast meat is generally known as pork roll in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and Taylor Ham in northern New Jersey Nighthawks a painting of a diner one type of eatery still common in the Mid Atlantic Each state of the region has its own signatures and the range extends from the Canadian border in the North to Delaware Bay in the South Other dishes came about during the early th century and have much to do with delicatessen fare set up largely by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who came to America incredibly poor often illiterate in any other language but Yiddish and often banished from mainstream society in their place of origin for centuries Most often they were completely unable to partake in the outdoor food markets that the general population utilized as most of the food for sale was not kosher The influence of European Jewry before their destruction in the Holocaust on modern mid Atlantic cooking remains strong and reinforced by their many descendants in the region These currently form the largest concentration of Jews outside Tel Aviv and are very integrated into the local mainstream of New York in particular American style pickles now a common addition to hamburgers and sandwiches were brought by Polish Jews and Austro Hungarian Jews brought a recipe for almond horns that now is a common regional cookie diverting from the original recipe in dipping the ends in dark chocolate New York style cheesecake has copious amounts of cream and eggs because animal rennet is not kosher and so could not be sold to a large number of the deli s clientele New York inherited its bagels and bialys from Jews as well as Challah bread Pastrami first entered the country via Romanian Jews and is a feature of many sandwiches often eaten on marble rye a bread that was born in the mid Atlantic Whitefish salad lox and matzoh ball soup are now standard fare made to order at local diners and delicatessens but started their life as foods that made up a strict dietary code Rugelach cookies and hamentashen are sweet staples still sold to the general public but came to New York over a century ago with Ashkenazi Jews along with Jewish rye Buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing served with lager beer Many of their dishes passed into the mainstream enough that they became standard fare in diners by the end of the th century a type of restaurant that is now the most common in the region and the subject matter of the artist Edward Hopper In the past this sort of establishment was the haven of the short order cook grilling or frying simple foods for the working man Today typical service includes staples from this large region like beef on weck Manhattan clam chowder the club sandwich Buffalo wings Philadelphia cheesesteak the black and white cookie shoofly pie snapper soup Smith Island cake blackout cake grape pie milkshakes and the egg cream a vanilla or chocolate fountain drink with a frothy top and fizzy taste As in Hopper s painting from  many of these businesses are open  hours a day Midwest Main article Cuisine of the Midwestern United States This region today comprises the states near the Great Lakes and also the Great Plains much of it is prairie with very flat terrain Winters are bitterly cold windy and wet Midwestern cuisine today is a very eclectic and odd mix and match of foodways covering everything from Kansas City style barbecue to the Chicago style hot dog though many of its classics are very simple hearty fare This region was mostly untouched by European and American settlers until after the American Revolutionary War and excepting Missouri and the heavily forested states near the Great Lakes was mainly populated by nomadic tribes like the Sioux Osage Arapaho and Cheyenne As with most other American Indian tribes these tribes consumed the Three Sisters of beans maize and squash but also for thousands of years followed the herds of bison hunting them on foot and later on horseback typically using bow and arrow There are buffalo jumps dating back nearly   years and several photographs and written accounts of trappers and homesteaders attesting to their dependence on the buffalo and to a lesser degree elk After nearly wiping out elk and bison this region has taken to raising bison alongside cattle for their meat and at an enormous profit making them into burgers and steaks Often that means harsh blizzards especially near the Great Lakes where Arctic winds blow off of Canada where ice on rivers and lakes freezes thick enough for ice hockey and for ice fishing for pike walleye and panfish to be ubiquitous In Minnesota Wisconsin and Michigan they often become part of the local fish fry Persimmon pudding The primary meats here are beef and poultry since the Midwest has been raising turkeys chickens and geese for over  years Chickens have been common for so long that the Midwest has several native breeds that are prized for both backyard farming and for farmer s markets such as the Buckeye and Wyandotte One Billina appears as a character in the second book of the Oz series by L Frank Baum Favorite fruits of the region include some native plants inherited from Native American tribes like the pawpaw and American persimmons are also highly favored As in the American South pawpaws are the region s largest native fruit about the size of a mango often found growing wild come September they are made into preserves and cakes and command quite a price at farmer s markets in Chicago The American persimmon is often smaller than its Japanese cousin about the size of a small plum but in the Midwest and parts of the East it is the main ingredient in the steamed persimmon pudding topped with cr me anglaise Other crops inherited from the Native Americans include wild rice which grows on the banks of lakes and is a local favorite for fancy meals and today often used in stuffing for Thanksgiving Typical fruits of the region are cold weather crops Once it was thought that its winters were too harsh for apples but a breeder in Minnesota produced the Wealthy apple and it became the third most productive region for apple growing in the country with local varieties comprising Wolf River Enterprise Melrose Paula Red Rome Beauty Honeycrisp and the Red Delicious Cherries are important to Michigan and Wisconsin grows many cranberries a legacy of early th century emigration of New England farmers Crabapple jelly is a favorite condiment of the region The influence of German Scandinavian and Slavic peoples on the northern portion of the region is very strong many emigrated to Wisconsin Minnesota Michigan Ohio and Illinois in the th century to take advantage of jobs in the meatpacking business as well as being homesteaders and tradesmen Bratwurst is a very common sausage eaten at tailgate parties for the Green Bay Packers Chicago Bears or Detroit Lions often served boiled in lager beer with sauerkraut different from many of the recipes currently found in Germany Polish sausage in particular a locally invented type of kielbasa is essential for sporting events in Chicago Chicago today has approximately   Polish speakers and has had a similar population for over  years When Poles came to Chicago and surrounding cities from Europe they brought with them long ropes of kielbasa cabbage rolls and pierogi Poles that left Poland after the fall of the Berlin Wall and descendants of earlier immigrants still make them and they remain common in local diners and delis Today alongside the pierogi the sausage is served on a long roll with mustard like a hot dog or as a Maxwell Street Polish a sandwich with caramelized onions In Cleveland the same sausage is served in the form of the Polish boy a sandwich made of french fries spicy barbecue sauce and coleslaw Unlike cities in the East where the hot dog alone is traditional fans of the Cleveland Indians Detroit Tigers Chicago Cubs Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers favor two or three different kinds of sausage sold in the pushcarts outside the stadium The hot dogs themselves tend to follow the Chicago style with mustard and pickled vegetables In Cincinnati where the Cincinnati Reds play there is a competitor in Cincinnati chili Invented by Macedonian immigrants it includes spaghetti as its base chili with a Mediterranean inspired spice mix and cheddar cheese the chili itself is often a topping for local hot dogs at games In the Midwest and especially Minnesota the tradition of the church potluck is a gathering where local foods reign and has been since the era of the frontier pioneers often needed to pool resources to have a celebration in the th century and that simply never changed Nowhere is this more clear than with the hotdish a type of casserole believed to have derived from a Norwegian recipe it is usually topped with potatoes or tater tots Next to the hotdish at potlucks usually glorified rice is found a kind of rice pudding mixed with crushed pineapple and maraschino cherries Next to that is the booyah a thick soup made of meat vegetables and seasonings that is meant to simmer on the stove for up to two days Lefse traditionally a Scandinavian flatbread has been handed down to descendants for over a hundred years and is common on the table Behind that is venison a popular meat around the Great Lakes and often eaten as steaks sandwiches and crown roasts for special events Within Wisconsin Minnesota and the Dakotas tiger meat a dish similar to steak tartare is common Last on the table are the dessert bars and brownies created originally in  in Chicago now a global food and international favorite Booyah a popular chunky stew of the Midwest that is often served to large numbers of people Further south barbecue has its own style in places in Kansas City and St Louis different from the South and American West Kansas City and St Louis were and are important hubs for the railroad that connected the plains with the Great Lakes and cities farther east like Philadelphia At the turn of the th century the St Louis area Omaha and Kansas City had huge stockyards waystations for cattle and pigs on their way east to the cities of the coast and north to the Great Lakes They all had large growing immigrant and migrant populations from Europe and the South respectively so the region has developed unique styles of barbecue St Louis style barbecue favors a heavy emphasis on a sticky sweet barbecue sauce Its standbys include the pork steak a cut taken from the shoulder of the pig grilled then slowly stewed in a pan over charcoal crispy snoots a cut from the cheek and nose of the pig that is fried up like cracklins and eaten dipped in sauce pork spare ribs and a mix of either beer boiled bratwurst or grilled Italian sausage flavored with fennel Dessert is usually something like gooey butter cake invented in the city in the s Kansas City style barbecue uses several different kinds of meat more than most styles of American barbecue turkey mutton pork and beef to name a few but is distinct from St Louis in that the barbecue sauce adds molasses in with the tomato based recipe and typically has a more tart taste Traditionally Kansas City uses a low and slow method of smoking the meat in addition to just stewing it in the sauce It also favors using hickory wood for smoking and continual watering or layering of the sauce while cooking to form a glaze with burnt ends this step is necessary to create the bark or charred outer layer of the brisket Southern United States Chicken and waffles Nashville hot chicken with potato salad Sweet tea Main article Cuisine of the Southern United States When referring to the American South as a region typically it should indicate Southern Maryland and the states that were once part of the Old Confederacy with the dividing line between the East and West jackknifing about  miles west of Dallas Texas and mostly south of the old Mason Dixon line Cities found in this area include New Orleans Atlanta Washington D C Memphis Charleston and Charlotte with Houston Texas being the largest The Florida Panhandle is usually considered part of the South but the Florida peninsula especially its lower half is not These states are much more closely tied to each other and have been part of U S territory for much longer than states much farther west than East Texas and in the case of food the influences and cooking styles are strictly separated as the terrain begins to change to prairie and desert from bayou and hardwood forest Peach cobbler is a popular Southern dessert This section of the country has some of the oldest known U S foodways with some recipes almost  years old Native American influences are still quite visible in the use of cornmeal as an essential staple and found in the Southern predilection for hunting wild game in particular wild turkey deer woodcock and various kinds of waterfowl for example coastal North Carolina is a place where hunters will seek tundra swan as a part of Christmas dinner the original English and Scottish settlers would have rejoiced at this revelation owing to the fact that such was banned among the commoner class in what is now the United Kingdom and naturally their descendants have not forgotten Native Americans also consumed turtles and catfish specifically the snapping turtle the alligator snapping turtle and blue catfish Catfish are often caught with one s bare hands gutted breaded and fried to make a Southern variation on English fish and chips and turtles are turned into stews and soups Native American tribes of the region such as the Cherokee or Choctaw often cultivated or gathered local plants like pawpaw maypop and several sorts of squashes and corn as food They also used spicebush and sassafras as spices and the aforementioned fruits are still cultivated as food in the South Maize is to this day found in dishes for breakfast lunch and dinner in the form of grits hoecakes baked cornbread and spoonbread and nuts like the hickory black walnut and pecan are commonly included in desserts and pastries as varied as mince pies pecan pie pecan rolls and honey buns both are types of sticky bun and quick breads which were themselves invented in the South during the American Civil War Peaches have been grown in this region since the th century and are a staple crop as well as a favorite fruit with peach cobbler being a signature dessert Early history European influence began soon after the settlement of Jamestown in  and the earliest recipes emerged by the end of the th century Specific influences from Europe were quite varied and they remain traditional and essential to the modern cookery overall German speakers often settled in the Piedmont on small farms from the coast and invented an American delicacy that is now nationally beloved apple butter based on their recipe for apfelkraut and later they introduced red cabbage and rye From the British Isles an enormous amount of influence was bestowed upon the South specifically foodways from th and th century Ulster the borderlands between England and Scotland the Scottish Highlands portions of Wales the West Midlands the West Country Black Country and Southern England Settlers bound for America fled the tumult of the Civil War Ulster and the Highland Clearances Often ships manifests show their belongings nearly always included cookpots or bakestones and seed stock for plants like peaches plums and apples to grow orchards which they planted in their hundreds Each group brought foods and ideas from their respective regions Settlers from Ireland and Scotland were well known for creating peatreak and poit n strong hard liquor based on fermenting potatoes or barley In time they came up with a method for distilling a corn mash with added sugar and aging in charred barrels made of select hardwoods which created a whiskey with a high proof This gave birth to American whiskey and Kentucky bourbon and its cousins moonshine and Everclear Closer to the coast th century recipes for English trifle turned into tipsy cakes replacing the sherry with whiskey and their recipe for pound cake brought to the South around the same time still works with American baking units one pound sugar one pound eggs one pound butter one pound flour Common features Biscuits and gravy Pork is the popular choice in  of Southern style barbecue and features in other preparations like sausages and sandwiches For most Southerners in the antebellum period corn and pork were staples of the diet Country sausage is an ingredient in the Southern breakfast dish of biscuits and gravy Country ham is often served for breakfast and cured with salt or sugar and hickory smoked Accompanying many meals is the southern style fluffy biscuit where the leavening agent is baking soda and often includes buttermilk and for breakfast they often accompany country ham grits and scrambled eggs Desserts Sweet potato pie Desserts in the South tend to be quite rich and very much a legacy of entertaining to impress guests since a Southern housewife was and to a degree still is expected to show her hospitality by laying out as impressive a banquet as she is able to manage Desserts are vast and encompass Lane cake sweet potato pie peach cobbler pecan pie hummingbird cake Jefferson Davis pie peanut brittle coconut cake apple fritters peanut cookies Moravian spice cookies chess pie doberge cake Lady Baltimore cake bourbon balls and caramel cake Red velvet cake American style sponge cakes tend to be the rule rather than the exception as is American buttercream a place where Southern baking intersects with the rest of the United States Nuts like pecan and hickory tend to be revered as garnishes for these desserts and they make their way into local bakeries as fillings for chocolates Cajun and Creole cuisine of Louisiana Shrimp gumbo is a popular Cajun and Creole dish In Louisiana cooking methods have more in common with rustic French cuisines of the th and th century than anything ever found at the French court in Versailles or the bistros of th and th century Paris this is especially true of Cajun cuisine Cajun French is more closely related to dialects spoken in Northern Maine New Brunswick and to a lesser degree Haiti than anything spoken in modern France and likewise their terminology methodology and culture concerning food is much more closely related to the styles of these former French colonies even today Unlike other areas of the South Cajuns were and still are largely Catholics and thus much of what they eat is seasonal for example pork is an important component of the Cajun boucherie a large community event where the hog is butchered prepared with a fiery spice mix and eaten snout to tail but it is never consumed in the five weeks of Lent when such would be forbidden Cajun cuisine tends to focus on what is locally available historically because Cajuns were often poor illiterate independent farmers and not plantation owners but today it is because such is deeply imbedded in local culture Boudin is a type of sausage found only in this area of the country and it is often by far more spicy than anything found in France or Belgium Chaudin is unique to the area and the method of cooking is comparable to the Scottish dish haggis the stuffing includes onions rice bell peppers spices and pork sewn up in the stomach of a pig and served in slices piping hot Crawfish are a staple of the Cajun grandmother s cookpot as they are abundant in the bayous of Southern Louisiana and a main source of livelihood as are blue crabs shrimp corn on the cob and red potatoes since these are the basic ingredients of the Louisiana crawfish boil Dishes typical of Louisiana Creole cuisine New Orleans has been the capital of Creole culture since before Louisiana was a state This culture is that of the colonial French and Spanish that evolved in the city of New Orleans which was and still is quite distinct from the rural culture of Cajuns and dovetails with what would have been eaten in antebellum Louisiana plantation culture long ago Cooking to impress and show one s wealth was a staple of Creole culture which often mixed French Spanish Italian German African Caribbean and Native American cooking methods producing rich dishes like oysters bienville pompano en papillote and even the muffaletta sandwich However Louisiana Creole cuisine tends to diverge from the original ideas brought to the region in ingredients profiteroles for example use a near identical choux pastry to that which is found in modern Paris but often use vanilla or chocolate ice cream rather than custard as the filling pralines nearly always use pecan and not almonds and bananas foster came about when New Orleans was a key port for the import of bananas from the Caribbean Sea Gumbos tend to be thickened with okra or the leaves of the sassafrass tree Andouille is often used but not the andouille currently known in France since French andouille uses tripe whereas Louisiana andouille is made from a Boston butt usually inflected with pepper flakes and smoked for hours over pecan wood Other ingredients that are native to Louisiana and not found in the cuisine of modern France would include rice which has been a staple of both Creole and Cajun cooking for generations and sugarcane which has been grown in Louisiana since the early s The maypop plant Ground cayenne pepper is a key spice of the region as is the meat of the American alligator something settlers learned from the Choctaws and Houma The maypop plant has been a favorite of Southerners for  years it gives its name to the Ocoee River in Tennessee a legacy of the Cherokees and in Southern Louisiana it is known as liane de grenade indicating its consumption by Cajuns It is a close relative of the commercial passionfruit similar in size and is a common plant growing in gardens all over the South as a source of fresh summertime fruit African American influences West African influences came with enslaved peoples from Ghana Benin Mali Congo Angola Sierra Leone Nigeria and other portions of the Gold Coast and the mark Africans and their descendants the African Americans have made on Southern food is strong today and an essential addition to the Southern table Crops like okra sorghum sesame seeds eggplant and many different kinds of melons were brought with them from West Africa along with the incredibly important introduction of rice to the Carolinas and later to Texas and Louisiana whence it became a staple grain of that region and still remains a staple in those areas today found in dishes like Hoppin John purloo and Charleston red rice Like the poorer indentured servants that came to the South slaves often got the leftovers of what was slaughtered for the consumption of the master of the plantation and so many recipes had to be adapted for offal like pig s ears and fatback though other methods encouraged low and slow methods of cooking to tenderize the tougher cuts of meat like braising smoking and pit roasting the last of which was a method known to West Africans in the preparation of roasting goat Peanut soup is one of the oldest known recipes brought to Virginia by Africans and over time through their descendants it has become creamier and milder tasting than the original Florida cuisine This section needs additional citations for

Floridian cuisine for example has a distinct way of cooking that includes different ingredients especially south of Tampa and Orlando Spain had control of the state until the early th century and used the southern tip as an outpost to guard the Spanish Main beginning in the s but Florida kept and still maintains ties with the Caribbean Sea including the Bahamas Haiti Cuba Puerto Rico the Dominican Republic and Jamaica South of Tampa there are and have been for a long time many speakers of Caribbean Spanish Haitian French Jamaican Patois and Haitian Creole and each Caribbean culture has a strong hold on cooking methods and spices in Florida In turn each mixes and matches with the foodways of the Seminole tribe and Anglophone settlers Thus for almost  years Floridian cooking has had a more tropical flavor than any other Southern state Allspice a spice originally from Jamaica is an ingredient found in spice mixes in summer barbecues along with ginger garlic scotch bonnet peppers sea salt and nutmeg in Floridian cooking this is often a variant of Jamaican jerk spice Coconuts are grown in the areas surrounding Miami and are shipped in daily through its port for consumption of the milk meat and water of the coconut Bananas are not just the yellow Cavendish variety found in supermarkets across America in Florida they are available as bananitos colorados pl tanos and maduros The first of these is a tiny miniature banana only about   inches   cm in length and it is sweet The second has a red peel and an apple like aftertaste and the third and fourth are used as a starch on nearly every Caribbean island as a side dish baked or fried all of the above are a staple of Florida outdoor markets when in season and all have been grown in the Caribbean for almost  years Mangoes are grown as a backyard plant in Southern Florida and otherwise are a favorite treat coming in many different shapes in sizes from Nam Doc Mai brought to Florida after the Vietnam War to Madame Francis a mango from Haiti Sweetsop and soursop are popular around Miami but nearly unheard of in other areas of the South Citrus is a major crop of Florida and features at many breakfast tables and many markets with the height of the season near the first week of January Hamlin oranges are the main cultivar planted and from this crop the rest of the United States and to a lesser extent Europe gets orange juice Other plantings would include grapefruits tangerines clementine oranges limes and even a few more rare ones like cara cara navels tangelos and the Jamaican Ugli fruit Tomatoes bell peppers habanero peppers and figs especially taken from the Florida strangler fig complete the produce menu Blue crab conch Florida stone crab red drum dorado and marlins tend to be local favorite ingredients Dairy is available in this region but it is less emphasized due to the year round warmth Traditional key lime pie a dessert from the islands off the coast of Miami is made with condensed milk to form the custard with the eye wateringly tart limes native to the Florida Keys in part because milk would spoil in an age before refrigeration Pork in this region tends to be roasted in methods similar to those found in Puerto Rico and Cuba owing to mass emigration from those countries in the th century especially in the counties surrounding Miami Orange blossom honey is a specialty of the state and is widely available in farmer s markets Caribbean lobster is a favorite special meal eagerly sought after by Floridians as it is found as far north as Fort Myers spear diving and collecting them from reefs in the Florida Keys and near rocky shoals is a common practice of local scuba divers Other small game Ptarmigan grouse crow blackbirds dove duck and other game fowl are consumed in the United States In the American state of Arkansas beaver tail stew is consumed in Cotton town Squirrel raccoon possum bear muskrat chipmunk skunk groundhog pheasant armadillo and rabbit are also consumed in the United States Cuisine in the West Main article Cuisine of the Western United States Cooking in the American West gets its influence from Native American and Hispanophone cultures as well as later settlers that came in the th century Texas for example has some influence from Germany in its choice of barbecue by using sausages Another instance can be found in the Northwestern region which encompasses Oregon Washington and Northern California All of the aforementioned rely on local seafood and a few classics of their own In New Mexico Colorado Nevada Arizona Utah West Texas and Southern California Mexican flavors and influences are extremely common especially from the Mexican states of Chihuahua Baja California and Sonora Northwest Cioppino The Pacific Northwest as a region includes Alaska and the state of Washington near the Canada US border and terminates near Sacramento California Here the terrain is mostly temperate rainforest on the coast mixed with pine forest as one approaches the Canada US border inland One of the core favorite foodstuffs is Pacific salmon native to many of the larger rivers of the area and often smoked or grilled on cedar planks In Alaska wild game like ptarmigan and moose meat feature extensively since much of the state is wilderness Fresh fish like steelhead trout Pacific cod Pacific halibut and pollock are fished for extensively and feature on the menu of many restaurants as do a plethora of fresh berries and vegetables like Cameo apples from Washington state the headquarters of the U S apple industry cherries from Oregon blackberries and marionberries a feature of many pies Hazelnuts are grown extensively in this region and are a feature of baking such as in chocolate hazelnut pie an Oregon favorite and Almond Roca is a local candy Like its counterpart on the opposite coast to the East there is a grand variety of shellfish in this region Geoducks are a native species of giant clam that have incredibly long necks they are eaten by the bucketful and shipped to Asia for millions of dollars as they are believed to be an aphrodisiac Gaper clams are a favorite food often grilled or steamed in a sauce Native California abalone is protected as a food source and a traditional foodway predating settlement by whites today featuring heavily in the cooking of fine restaurants as well as in home cooking in mirin flavored soups the influence of Japanese cooking is strong in the region noodle dishes and on the barbecue Native Olympia oysters are served on the half shell as well as the Kumamoto oyster introduced by Japanese immigrants and a staple at dinner as an appetizer California mussels are a delicacy of the region and have been a feature of the cooking for generations There is evidence that Native American tribes consumed them up and down the California coast for centuries Crabs are a delicacy and included in this are Alaskan king crab red crab yellow crab and Dungeness crab Californian and Oregonian sportsmen pursue the last three extensively using hoop nets and prepare them in a multitude of ways Alaskan king crab able to grow as large as  kg is often served steamed for a whole table with lemon butter sauce or put in chunks of salad with avocado and native crabs are the base of dishes like the California roll cioppino a tomato based fisherman s stew and Crab Louie another kind of salad native to San Francisco Favorite grains are mainly wheat and the region is known for sourdough bread Cheeses of the region include Humboldt Fog Cougar Gold and Teleme Southwest and Southern California Main article Cuisine of the Southwestern United States Mixed beef and chicken fajita ingredients served on a hot iron skillet The states of the Four Corners Arizona New Mexico Colorado and Utah plus Nevada Southern California and West Texas make up a large chunk of the United States There is a distinct Hispanic accent to the cookery here with each having cultural capitals in Albuquerque Denver Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix Santa Fe San Diego and Tucson For centuries prior to California s statehood in the s it was part of the Spanish Empire namely Alta California modern California Santa Fe de Nuevo M xico modern New Mexico and Tejas modern Texas Today it is home of a large population of Native Americans Hispanos descendants of the American frontier Asian Americans and immigrants from Mexico and Latin America California New Mexico and Texas continue to hold their unique identities which is reflected in their distinct regional cuisines the multiple cuisines of California New Mexican cuisine Texan cuisine and Tex Mex Spanish is a commonly spoken secondary language here the state of New Mexico has its own distinct dialect With the exception of Southern California the signature meat is beef since this is one of the two regions in which cowboys lived and modern cattle ranchers still eke out their living today High quality beefstock is a feature that has been present in the region for more than  years and the many cuts of beef are unique to the United States These cuts of meat are different from the related Mexican cuisine over the border in that certain kind of offal like lengua tongue cabeza head and tripas tripe are considered less desirable and are thus less emphasized Typical cuts would include the ribs brisket sirloin flank steak skirt steak and t bone Chili con carne a typical Tex Mex dish with garnishes and tortilla chips Historically Spanish settlers that came to the region found it completely unsuitable to the mining operations that much older settlements in Mexico had to offer as their technology was not advanced enough to extract the silver that would later be found They had no knowledge of the gold in California which would not be found until  and knew even less about the silver in Nevada undiscovered until after the Civil War Instead in order to make the pueblos prosper they adapted the old rancho system of places like Andalusia in Spain and brought the earliest beefstock among these were breeds that would go feral and become the Texas longhorn and Navajo Churro sheep still used as breeding stock because they are easy to keep and well adapted to the extremely arid and hot climate where temperatures easily exceed  C Later cowboys learned from their management practices many of which still stand today like the practical management of stock on horseback using the Western saddle Biscochitos the state cookie of New Mexico Likewise settlers learned the cooking methods of those who came before and local tribes as well for example portions of Arizona and New Mexico still use the aforementioned beehive shaped clay contraption called an horno an outdoor wood fired oven both Native American tribes like the Navajo and Spaniards used for roasting meat maize and baking bread Meats that see frequent use are elk meat a favorite in crown roasts and burgers and nearer the Mexican border rattlesnake often skinned and stewed The taste for alcohol tends toward light and clean flavors found in tequila a staple of this region since the days of the Wild West and a staple in the bartender s arsenal for cocktails especially in Las Vegas In Utah a state heavily populated by Mormons alcohol is frowned upon by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints but still available in area bars in Salt Lake City mainly consumed by the populations of Catholics and other Protestant denominations living there Introduction of agriculture was limited prior to the th century and the development of better irrigation techniques but included the addition of peaches a crop still celebrated by Native American tribes like the Havasupai and oranges Today in Arizona Texas and New Mexico the favored orange today is the Moro blood orange which often finds its way into the local cuisine like cakes and marmalade Pine nuts are a particular regional specialty and feature often in fine dining and cookies in Nevada the Native American tribes that live there are by treaty given rights to exclusive harvest and in New Mexico they reserve usage of the term pi on for certain species of indigenous pine nuts From Native Americans Westerners learned the practice of eating cactus fruit from the myriad species of opuntia that occupy the Chihuahuan Sonoran and Mojave desert lands In California Spanish missionaries brought with them the mission fig and today this fruit is a delicacy New Mexico green chile is a staple of New Mexican cuisine Cuisine in this region tends to have certain key ingredients tomatoes onions black beans pinto beans rice bell peppers chile peppers and cheese in particular Monterey Jack invented in Southern California in the th century and itself often further altered into pepper Jack where spicy jalape o peppers are incorporated into the cheese to create a smoky taste Chili peppers play an important role in the cuisine with a few native to the region This is especially true with the region s distinct New Mexico chile pepper still grown by Hispanos of New Mexico and Puebloans the most sought after of which come from the Hatch valley Albuquerque s Central Rio Grande Chimayo and Pueblos In New Mexico chile is eaten on a variety of foods such as the green chile cheeseburger made popular by fast food chains such as Blake s Lotaburger Indeed even national fast food chains operating in the state such as McDonald s offer locally grown chile on many of their menu items In the th century a few more recent additions have arrived like the poblano pepper rocoto pepper ghost pepper thai chili pepper and Korean pepper the last three especially when discussing Southern California and its large population from East and South Asia Cornbread is consumed however the recipe differs from ones in the East in that the batter is cooked in a cast iron skillet Outdoor cooking is popular and still utilizes an old method settlers brought from the East with them in which a cast iron Dutch oven is covered with the coals of the fire and stacked or hung from a tripod this is different from the earthenware pots of Mexico Tortillas are still made the traditional way here and form an important component of the spicy breakfast burrito which contains ham eggs and salsa or pico de gallo They are also used for regular burritos which contains any combination of marinated meats vegetables and piquant chilis smothered burritos often both containing and topped with New Mexico chile sauces quesadillas a much loved grilled dish where cheese and other ingredients are stuffed between two tortillas and served by the slice and steak fajitas where sliced skirt steak sizzles in a skillet with caramelized onions Nachos with cheese Unlike Mexico tortillas of this region also may incorporate vegetables like spinach into the flatbread dough to make wraps which were invented in Southern California Food here tends to use pungent spices and condiments typically chili verde sauce various kinds of hot sauce sriracha sauce chili powder cayenne pepper white pepper cumin paprika onion powder thyme and black pepper Nowhere is this fiery mix of spice more evident than in the dishes chili con carne a meaty stew and cowboy beans both of which are a feature of regional cookoffs Southern California has several additions like five spice powder rosemary curry powder kimchi and lemongrass with many of these brought by recent immigration to the region and often a feature of Southern California s fusion cuisine popular in fine dining In Texas the local barbecue is often entirely made up of beef brisket or large rib racks where the meat is seasoned with a spice rub and cooked over coals of mesquite In other portions of the state they smoke the meat and peppery sausages over high heat using pecan apple and oak wood and serve it with a side of pickled vegetables a legacy of German and Czech settlers of the late s California is home to Santa Maria style barbecue where the spices involved generally are black pepper paprika and garlic salt and grill over the coals of coast live oak A chimichanga Native American additions may include Navajo frybread and corn on the cob often roasted on the grill in its husk A typical accompaniment or appetizer of all these states is the tortilla chip which sometimes includes cornmeal from cultivars of corn that are blue or red in addition to the standard yellow of sweetcorn and is served with salsa of varying hotness Tortilla chips also are an ingredient in the Tex Mex dish nachos where these chips are loaded with any combination of ground beef melted Monterey Jack cheddar or Colby cheese guacamole sour cream and salsa and Texas usually prefers a version of potato salad as a side dish For alcohol a key ingredient is tequila this spirit has been made on both sides of the US Mexican border for generations and in modern cuisine it is a must have in a bartender s arsenal as well as an addition to dishes for sauteeing Southern California is focused more towards the coast and has had more contact with immigration from the West Pacific and Baja California in addition to having the international city of Los Angeles as its capital Here the prime mode of transportation is by car Drive through fast food was invented in this area but so was the concept of the gourmet burger movement giving birth to chains like In N Out Burger with many variations of burgers including chili multiple patties avocado special sauces and Angus or wagyu beef Common accompaniments include thick milkshakes in various flavors like mint chocolate peanut butter vanilla strawberry and mango Smoothies are a common breakfast item made with fresh fruit juice yogurt and crushed ice Agua fresca a drink originated by Mexican immigrants is a common hot weather beverage sold in many supermarkets and at mom and pop stands available in citrus watermelon and strawberry flavors the California version usually served chilled without grain in it Machaca with pork eggs and potatoes wrapped in a tortilla served with salsa The weather in Southern California is such that the temperature rarely drops below  F  C in winter thus sun loving crops like pistachios kiwifruit avocadoes strawberries and tomatoes are staple crops of the region the last often dried in the sun and a feature of salads and sandwiches Olive oil is a staple cooking oil of the region and has been since the days of Jun pero Serra today the mission olive is a common tree growing in a Southern Californian s back garden As a crop olives are increasingly a signature of the region along with Valencia oranges and Meyer lemons Soybeans bok choy Japanese persimmon thai basil Napa cabbage nori mandarin oranges water chestnuts and mung beans are other crops brought to the region from East Asia and are common additions to salads as the emphasis on fresh produce in both Southern and Northern California is strong Other vegetables and herbs have a distinct Mediterranean flavor which would include oregano basil summer squash eggplant and broccoli with all of the above extensively available at farmers markets all around Southern California Naturally salads native to Southern California tend to be hearty affairs like Cobb salad and Chinese chicken salad and dressings like green goddess and ranch are a staple California style pizza tends to have disparate ingredients with an emphasis on vegetables with any combination of chili oil prawns eggs chicken shiitake mushrooms olives bell pepper goat cheese and feta cheese Peanut noodles tend to include a sweet dressing with lo mein noodles and chopped peanuts Fresh fish and shellfish in Southern California tends to be expensive in restaurants but every year since the end of WWII the Pismo clam festival has taken place where the local population takes a large species of clam and bakes stuffs and roasts it as it is a regional delicacy Fishing for pacific species of octopus and the Humboldt squid are common and both are a feature of East Asian and other L A fish markets Lingcod is a coveted regional fish that is often caught in the autumn off the coast of San Diego and in the Channel Islands and often served baked California sheephead are often grilled and are much sought after by spear fishermen and the immigrant Chinese population in which case it is basket steamed Most revered of all in recent years is the California spiny lobster a beast that can grow to  lb and is a delicacy that now rivals the fishery for Dungeness crab in its importance Pacific and Hawaiian cuisine Main article Cuisine of Hawaii Lomi lomi salmon Hawaii is often considered to be one of the most culturally diverse U S states as well as being the only state with an Asian majority population and one of the few places where United States territory extends into the tropics As a result Hawaiian cuisine borrows elements of a variety of cuisines particularly those of Asian and Pacific rim cultures as well as traditional native Hawaiian and a few additions from the American mainland American influence in the last  years has brought cattle goats and sheep to the islands introducing cheese butter and yogurt products as well as crops like red cabbage Major Asian and Polynesian influences on modern Hawaiian cuisine are from Japan Korea Vietnam China especially near the Pearl River delta Samoa and the Philippines From Japan the concept of serving raw fish as a meal with rice was introduced as was soft tofu setting the stage for the popular dish called poke From Korea immigrants to Hawaii brought a love of spicy garlic marinades for meat and kimchi From China their version of char siu baau became modern manapua a type of steamed pork bun with a spicy filling Filipinos brought vinegar bagoong and lumpia and during the th century immigrants from American Samoa brought the open pit fire umu and the Vietnamese introduced lemongrass and fish sauce Each East Asian culture brought several different kinds of noodles including udon ramen mei fun and pho and today these are common lunchtime meals Much of this cuisine mixes and melts into traditions like the lu au whose traditional elaborate fare was once the prerogative of kings and queens but is today the subject of parties for both tourists and also private parties for the ohana meaning family and close friends Traditionally women and men ate separately under the Hawaiian kapu system a system of religious beliefs that honored the Hawaiian gods similar to the Maori tapu system though in this case had some specific prohibitions towards females eating things like coconut pork turtle meat and bananas as these were considered parts of the male gods Punishment for violation could be severe as a woman might endanger a man s mana or soul by eating with him or otherwise by eating the forbidden food because doing so dishonored the male gods As the system broke down after  introductions of foods from laborers on plantations began to be included at feasts and much cross pollination occurred where Asian foodstuffs mixed with Polynesian foodstuffs like breadfruit kukui nuts and purple sweet potatoes Some notable Hawaiian fare includes seared ahi tuna opakapaka snapper with passionfruit Hawaiian island raised lamb beef and meat products Hawaiian plate lunch and Molokai shrimp Seafood traditionally is caught fresh in Hawaiian waters and particular delicacies are ula poni papaikualoa opihi and opihi malihini better known as Hawaiian spiny lobster Kona crab Hawaiian limpet and abalone the last brought over with Japanese immigrants Some cuisine also incorporates a broad variety of produce and locally grown agricultural products including tomatoes sweet Maui onions taro and macadamia nuts Tropical fruits also play an important role in the cuisine as a flavoring in cocktails and in desserts including local cultivars of bananas sweetsop mangoes lychee coconuts papayas and lilikoi passionfruit Pineapples have been an island staple since the th century and figure into many marinades and drinks Common dishes found on a regional level

influence of ethnicity specific cuisines like Italian cuisine and Mexican cuisine was present in the United States by World War I There are recipes for Chilean meat pies chicken chop suey chow mein Mexican pork pastries and Italian meatballs going back to at least the s but many of the recipes were Anglicized and they appeared relatively infrequently compared to Northern European recipes th century cookbooks bear evidence of diverse influences with some including recipes like Indian pickle Italian pork and various curries th century literature shows knowledge of Jewish Russian Italian Chinese and Greek American cuisines and foreign cookbooks continued to grow more detailed through World War I including recipes like Peruvian chicken Mexican enchiladas Chilean corn pudding and Hindustan chicken curry Louise Rice author of Dainty Dishes from Foreign Lands describes the recipes in her book as not wholly vegetarian though noting at the time of publication in  that most of the recipes would likely be new to average American cooks and likely contain higher proportions of vegetables to meat She includes Italian pasta recipes like macaroni in milk soups and polentas and German

chefs to reclaim America s ethnic foods within its regional traditions where these trends originated One of the earliest was Paul Prudhomme who in  began the introduction of his influential cookbook Paul Prodhomme s Louisiana Kitchen by describing the over  year history of Creole and Cajun cooking he aims to preserve and expand the Louisiana tradition Prodhomme s success quickly inspired other chefs Norman Van Aken embraced a Floridian type cuisine fused with many ethnic and globalized elements in his Feast of Sunlight cookbook in  California became swept up in the movement then seemingly started to lead the trend itself in for example the popular restaurant Chez Panisse in Berkeley Examples of the Chez Panisse phenomenon chefs who embraced a new globalized cuisine were celebrity chefs like Jeremiah Tower and Wolfgang Puck both former colleagues at the restaurant Puck went on to describe his belief in contemporary new style American cuisine in the introduction to The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook Another major breakthrough whose originators were once thought to be crazy is the mixing of ethnic cuisines It is not at all uncommon to find raw fish listed next to tortillas on the same menu Ethnic crossovers also occur when distinct elements meet in a single recipe This country is after all a huge melting pot Why should its cooking not illustrate the American transformation of diversity into unity Puck s former colleague Jeremiah Tower became synonymous with California Cuisine and the overall American culinary revolution Meanwhile the restaurant that inspired both Puck and Tower became a distinguished establishment popularizing its so called mantra in its book by Paul Bertolli and owner Alice Waters Chez Panisse Cooking in  Published well after the restaurants founding in  this new cookbook from the restaurant seemed to perfect the idea and philosophy that had developed over the years The book embraced America s natural bounty specifically that of California while containing recipes that reflected Bertoli and Waters appreciation of both northern Italian and French style foods Early ethnic influences Adaptation of Mexican food tailored for the mainstream American market usually is different from Mexican food typically served in Mexico While the earliest cuisine of the United States was influenced by Native Americans the thirteen colonies or the antebellum South the overall culture of the nation its gastronomy and the growing culinary arts became ever more influenced by its changing ethnic mix and immigrant patterns from the th and th centuries unto the present Some of the ethnic groups that continued to influence the cuisine were here in prior years others arrived more numerously during The Great Transatlantic Migration of   or other mass migrations Some of the ethnic influences could be found across the nation after the American Civil War and into the continental expansion for most of the th century Ethnic influences already in the nation at that time would include the following groups and their respective cuisines Select nationalities of Europe and the respective developments from early modern European cuisine of the colonial age British Americans and on going developments in New England cuisine the national traditions founded in the cuisine of the original thirteen colonies The Cuisine of the Southern United

some five million English Irish German Scandinavian and others from northwestern Europe came to the United States one from  to  in which some  million immigrants also mainly from northwestern Europe settled and a third from  to  in which  million immigrants mainly from central eastern and southern Europe many Austrian Hungarian Turkish Lithuanian Russian Jewish Greek Italian and Romanian settled in the United States Together with earlier arrivals to the United States including the indigenous Native Americans Hispanic and Latino Americans particularly in the West Southwest and Texas African Americans who came to the United States in the Atlantic slave trade and early colonial migrants from Europe these new waves of immigrants had a profound impact on national or regional cuisine Some of these more prominent groups include the following Albanian Americans Albanian cuisine Arab Americans particularly Lebanese Americans the largest ethnic Arab group in the United States Arab cuisine

ingredientsSugar flour egg whites cream of tartar Media Angel food cake Angel food cake or angel cake is a type of sponge cake made with egg whites flour and sugar A whipping agent such as cream of tartar is commonly added It differs from other cakes because it uses no butter It s aerated texture comes from whipped egg white Angel food cake originated in the United States and first became popular in the late th century It gained its unique reputation along with its name due to its light and fluffy texture and white color Description Angel food cake requires egg whites whipped until they are stiff Cream of tartar is added to the mixture to stabilize the egg whites Remaining ingredients are gently folded into the egg white mixture For this method of leavening to work well it is useful to have flour that has been made of softer wheat Cake flour is generally used because of its light texture The softer wheat and the lack of fat cause angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste Angel food cake should be cut with a serrated blade as a straight edged blade tends to compress the cake rather than slice it Forks electric serrated knives special tined cutters or a strong thread should be used instead Angel food cake is usually baked in a tube pan a tall round pan with a tube up the centre that leaves a hole in the middle of the cake A bundt pan may also be used but the fluted sides can make releasing the cake more difficult The center tube allows the cake batter to rise higher by clinging to all sides of the pan The angel food cake pan should not be greased unlike pans used to prepare other cakes This allows the cake to have a surface upon which to crawl up helping it to rise After baking the cake pan is inverted while cooling to prevent the cake from falling in on itself Angel food cake is sometimes frosted but more often has some sort of sauce such as a sweet fruit sauce drizzled over it A simple glaze is also popular Recently many chefs Alton Brown in particular have popularized the idea of adding aromatic spices such as mace and cloves to the cake Angel food cake tube pan Angel food cake in a bundt pan Angel food cake showing its texture History Angel food cake is a white sponge cake made with only stiffly beaten egg whites yolks would make it yellow and inhibit the stiffening of the whites and no butter The first recipe in a cookbook for a white sponge cake is in Lettice Bryan s The Kentucky Housewife of  Since there is no butter in the cake the angel food cake is not related to the butter cakes snow drift cake silver cake or lady cake The Home Messenger Book of Tested Recipes d ed  by Isabella Stewart contained the first recipe for Angel s Food Cake Stewart s detailed recipe called for eleven egg whites sugar flour vanilla extract and cream of tartar Uses An angel food cake with various toppings and frosting The cake is often served with berries and eaten for dessert The name which comes from the texture which is so light that angels could eat it and still fly without being weighted down has given it a special association in some communities Among African Americans the cake is often served at funeral receptions with the idea that the deceased person is now living in Heaven among the angels Among the Pennsylvania Dutch it is considered a wedding cake and the couple is said to be blessed by angels The most traditional method also known as the angel food cake method is as follows First the egg whites and possibly salt vanilla extract and cream of tartar are mixed at a medium speed until a soft peak forms Whipping continues while the sugar is slowly added Once a hard peak is formed the flour is folded into the mixture of egg whites and sugar This technique is done in order to disturb the foam as little as possible Different equipment is used when preparing an angel food cake at home or in a small bakery as opposed to a large scale production Many recipes found in cookbooks advise bakers to whip the egg whites in a copper bowl The theory behind this is that the whisk incorporates copper particles or ovotransferrin which is attached to copper particles into the egg whites improving the flexibility and stability of the foam Some research has found that the copper significantly increases the dilatational elasticity which is the elasticity of the protein cell wall at the interface of air water A planetary mixer such as a stand mixer or handheld mixer is appropriate for a homemade or bakery cake If the cake is being mass produced a continuous mixer is preferred There are three methods in which the cake can be made at home or in a commercial setting The first two methods are most commonly used at home or in a small bakery using planetary mixers in various sizes Large planetary mixers may have a vacuum in order to pressurize the ingredients This allows for control of the emulsion and temperature The first method is the foam process or angel food cake method The egg whites are whipped until a foam is formed before any other ingredients are added This method ensures that the foam is not disturbed when it is being formed and that the maximum number of bubbles stay intact Another method is called the meringue process This entails whipping all or most of the ingredients together at the same time This may result in a lower quality foam and a final cake with a reduced volume The last method is called the continuous process and is usually used in commercial bakeries because it creates a consistent product in large volumes Ingredients are fed into the continuous mixer in either one or two stages A one stage process mixes all of the ingredients together and feeds them into an emulsion head Upon entry into the emulsion head air is incorporated fully mixing the batter In a two stage process the ingredients are blended separately in different tanks according to the recipe The speed of the mixer is controlled as well as air flow to help mix the batter The final batter may then go through a static mixer a pipe with a spiral blade inside to be deposited in a tube pan depositor or hopper Angel food cake batter Close up view of the batter Normally angel food cakes are baked in a straight sided tube pan but similar pans such as a bundt pan are acceptable It is very important that the pan does not have a non stick surface and that no grease is applied to the sides or around the tube As the cake bakes it expands and rises The sides and hollow center tube act as supports for the foam as it expands The hollow pan also allows for an even heat distribution For the optimal angel food cake outcome experts believe that the cake should be baked for at the shortest amount of time at the highest temperature The temperature and duration depends on the size and weight of the cake Temperatures range from  F  C to  F  C while baking time ranges from  minutes to one hour Suas M  If the angel food cake does not bake long enough the foam and gel structures will not reach their full potential In a bakery angel food cakes could be baked in a rack oven revolving oven convention oven or small deck oven A commercial bakery may use a tunnel or traveling oven When the cake has finished baking it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area The final volume will generally be two to three times larger than the batter volume Angel food cakes are cooled upside down Some tube pans have feet or fingers that extend off of the top rim of the pan The feet are placed on a cooling rack If the pan does not have feet it is customary for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube to ensure that the pan is elevated The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake so that it cools properly If a non stick pan or greased pan were used the cake would fall out when inverted leading to a collapsed cake Angel food cakes have a shelf life of a few days at room temperature or up to a week in a refrigerator because of the tendency for moisture to migrate and evaporate After a few days the cake will be dry and lack flexibility Molecular and structural composition Egg whites Whipped egg whites Egg whites play an integral role in the structure of the baked cake Egg whites are composed of many proteins however only ovalbumin conalbumin lysozyme and globulins have properties which aid in creating a voluminous angel food cake Ovalbumin and globulins will produce a foam that is equal to or greater than the size of the egg whites Egg white proteins have many uses in baking one of which is the ability to create and maintain a foam Whipping incorporates air throughout the egg whites as well as denaturing or unfolding the proteins to create thinner protein molecules Overrun similar to lightness describes the amount of air pushed into the foam In terms of an angel food cake overrun is the increase in volume from the original volume caused by the inclusion of air The overrun of an egg white foam ranges from  to  This means that whipping  mL of egg whites would result in   mL of air incorporated into the foam During whipping protein adsorption allows for rapid foam formation Adsorption is the ability to spontaneously form a very thin layer on a surface The denatured proteins move to the air water interface to create the cell walls of the air bubbles Cell wall formation occurs when the denatured proteins aggregate forming an extremely thin network or film Many interactions between the proteins and the interface are involved including hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions disulfide bonds and Van der Waals interactions A cake made with egg yolks would not be as light and airy because they have a lower foaming ability than egg whites This move to the air water interface by the proteins is also aided by their hydrophobic and hydrophilic part The hydrophobic moieties orient themselves toward the air while the hydrophilic moieties orient themselves toward the water portion of the interface The air molecules at the air water interface interact less with the other molecules that are fully inside the bubble This lack of interaction causes the air molecules to have excess energy resulting in surface tension The presence of egg white proteins at the interface acts as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension and promotes foam development A foam is a type of emulsion air in an aqueous solution If the surface tension was not lowered the air bubbles would coalescence and the emulsion would separate The interfacial dilational modulus E describes how the egg white proteins or surfactants covering the air water interface are able to resist deformation from stretching or compression An elastic and viscosity component are incorporated into the value which account for the energy that is lost and recovered as a result of deformation E d d ln A where E interfacial dilational modulus change in interfacial tension A change in interfacial area at a constant shape The most stable and voluminous foams are created when the egg white proteins are near their isoelectric points Protein adsorption is most rapid at the isoelectric point because electrostatic repulsion is reduced for proteins with a neutral net charge The viscoelasticity of protein foam films is usually at its highest near its isoelectric point This is why acid is usually added to the cake batter in order to adjust the pH The preparation of the batter should be done as quickly as possible When the foam sits disproportionation will occur This is the result of water draining from the foam and collecting at the bottom The bubbles at the top of the foam will grow larger as the water leaves and the cell walls or film become too weak and break forming larger bubbles Whipping aids Whipping aids improve the foaming properties of albumen a protein found in egg whites which means a firmer foam will be established in a shorter amount of time Cream of tartar is an acidic salt which adjusts the pH of egg whites so the proteins will be more soluble as well as reducing protein denaturation during whipping If cream of tartar is not used the cake may not reach its maximum achievable volume Cream of tartar also decolorizes the flavone pigments in flour giving a final cake that is a bright white color The whiteness of the cake is also caused by the way cream of tartar creates very small and uniform air bubbles which gives the cake the appearance of being whiter after baking Flour The baking process causes the batter to expand and go from a liquid to a solid foam The proteins will not start to denature until the temperature reaches around  F  C During this rise in temperature the air bubbles will either expand coalesce or break An egg white foam will continue to expand uniformly until the internal temperature reaches   F   C Based on the ideal gas law as the temperature increases the volume of the air bubbles will expand The temperature will continue to rise causing the cake to expand at different rates and egg white proteins will gradually denature Some of the egg white proteins will start to denature and coagulate at around  F  C This establishes the setting of the foam structure By the time the temperature reaches  F  C all of the egg white proteins will have set in place The foam structure will decrease slightly or collapse in order to form a solid foam of less volume This occurs while the cake is still baking not when it is cooling The combination of protein denaturation and starch gelatinization determines whether the cake will set or collapse When proteins denature they are not in a stable state In order to stabilize the denatured proteins will aggregate around air bubbles and within the continuous phase of the batter The aggregation and overlapping of the proteins forms a very stable network The flour plays an important role in the texture structure and elasticity of an angel food cake Minimal folding of the flour allows cell walls to form when it comes in contact with the egg protein foam and sugar mixture If the batter is over mixed the egg white proteins may coagulate causing the bubbles to break during baking or the cell walls may become too rigid lacking elasticity This would reduce the volume and result in a coarse texture However if the batter is under mixed a weak foam will form A gluten matrix is formed when the proteins glutenin and gliadin found in wheat flour are mixed in the presence of water When the batter is agitated these two proteins form cross links disulfide bonds ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds The matrix that forms is strong and very flexible Although no water is added to the batter the gluten reacts with the water found in egg whites Since air has already been entrapped in the foam the flour proteins can only coat the already entrapped air This helps to strengthen the cell walls and batter during baking or any other handling This is beneficial because the meringue on its own is weak cannot expand in heat and does not have any elasticity normally expected in cakes Starch gelatinization occurs around the same time as when expansion stops and the cake sets or collapses When starch granules are exposed to heat and water they swell leaching out some starch and forming hydrogen bonds with other starch granules About  of the starch granules are gelatinized Starch granules create very strong and rigid gel networks The starch gel network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network The formation of the starch gel may interfere with expanding bubbles causing them to burst and air to leave the cake This would result in a collapsed cake Sugar Sugar functions as a sweetener stabilizer and tenderizer The amount of sugar has a large impact on the overrun and stability of the foam When sugar and egg whites are whipped together a meringue is formed If the amount of sugar is less than or equal to the amount of egg whites a soft meringue is formed A stiffer meringue is formed when there is more sugar than egg white Angel food cakes usually have equal parts sugar and egg white Sugar will disturb protein foam formation in a positive or negative manner It is also important that the sugar is added slowly so that the crystals have a chance to dissolve It is typically added after a weak foam has been formed This way it can help stabilize the foam instead of impeding on it causing coagulation and collapse When the sugar dissolves it interacts with the proteins at the air water interface creating a thicker and more stable cell wall The sugar can also assist in the denaturing and aggregation of egg white proteins which increases overrun giving a lighter texture Sugar binds water through hydrogen bonds which allows for a moist final cake and why all of the moisture does not leave during baking Since there is no shortening butter fat or oil sugar is the only tenderizer The more sugar added the more tender the cake will be However if too much is added the cake may collapse because the foam structure is not strong enough to support itself When the cake has finished baking it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area This is due to Maillard browning reactions If the cake bakes for too long more moisture will be removed and the texture will turn out dry rough and potentially burnt Additional ingredients in commercially produced cakes Commercial bakeries have a need to reduce cost and increase the shelf life for mass produced products For these reasons they use many ingredients that deviate from the traditional angel food cake recipe Dehydrated and frozen egg whites are cheaper and more efficient than fresh egg whites However each lot of dehydrated egg whites varies from the next This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture moisture volume and height Surfactants that have been used to improve the whipping properties of dehydrated eggs are sodium desoxycholate triethyl citrate triacetin sodium oleate and oleic acid Frozen egg whites do not form as firm or stable foams as fresh egg whites It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than fresh eggs Acids can be added in manufacturing such as acetic malic tartaric and citric These improve the color and cake structure by lowering the pH however they do not work as well as cream of tartar Instead of using pure cake flour wheat flour or a mixture of wheat flour and raw wheat starch is used The wheat flour is bleached to remove any brown pigments and produce a bright white color The pH of the bleached flour is between  and   although the optimal pH of starch gelatinization is between   and   Acidifiers are used in order to reach this pH range The optimal flour protein content is between  and  and must be below   If a mixture is used at least  by weight should be wheat flour A small amount of raw wheat starch may be added to the sugar as a grinding aid Pregelatinized starch may be added to increase the rate of starch gelatinization One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until a gel forms The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it Once all the water has been removed a starch cake is left on the roll The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder When the pregelatinized starch powder is subjected to water a gel forms The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the entrapped air while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake The gel is not as strong has it would be if a normal starch was mixed with water and heated However the combination of pregelatinized starch and starch in the wheat flour create an acceptable gel together Typically corn starch is used however a variety of other starches also work A balanced chemical leavening such sodium bicarbonate along with an acidifier is another common ingredient When reacted together the acidifier has the ability to release all of the carbon dioxide from the sodium bicarbonate A variety of acidifiers can be used including potassium bitartrate tartaric acid and disodium phosphate The type of acidifier used depends on when the preferred release of CO is If the release would be most beneficial when the batter is forming citric acid would be ideal because it is fast acting The amount of acidifier depends on which agent such as sodium bicarbonate is used because they have varying neutralization points An excess acidifier is also added however it is not used in combination with the sodium bicarbonate Instead it lowers the batter pH to facilitate the starch gelatinization and maintain the egg white protein foam volume in the baking cake At a lower pH the egg white proteins are able to entrap more air during both preparation and baking The optimal pH for the batter is between   and   It also helps to create a whiter cake which is more desirable to consumers It is typical that the excess acidifier is the same as that used to react with the balanced chemical leavener Adding a small amount of calcium chloride may be used to alter the pH to the optimum value when dehydrated egg whites with a higher pH are used It may also alter the flour gelatinization temperature This ensures that when large quantities of cakes are produced the cakes will be the best possible quality and volume without a gummy layer forming A whipping aid such as modified soy protein can help to account for the decreased foaming ability of dehydrated or frozen egg whites Modified soy protein is a soy protein in a solution which is then acidified using hydrochloric acid Pepsin or another enzyme is then added to enhance the protein foaming abilities Once the enzyme activity has ceased the solution is heated to deactivate the enzyme and more hydrochloric acid is added if a pH adjustment is required Oxidized wheat starch is a tenderizing agent that may be added to give the angel food cake a lighter texture Raw wheat starch is treated with sodium hypochlorite neutralized purified and dried The final starch has molecules with shorter chain lengths which prevents the gel network from being too tough Unlike a homemade angel food cake water may be used when mixing the dry ingredients as well as to reconstitute dehydrated egg whites See also A variety of chocolate cake known as Devil s food cake considered Angel food s counterpart is another popular American cake that was developed later However unlike angel food cake devil s food cake is a type of butter cake Chiffon cake References a b c Davidson Alan and Tom Jaine The Oxford

word which refers to a different dessert in the UK Canada Australia and New Zealand Ingredients usually include cooked apples butter sugar flour cinnamon and often oats and brown sugar ginger and or nutmeg One of the most common variants is apple rhubarb crisp in which the rhubarb provides a tart contrast to the apples Many other kinds of fruit crisps are also made these may substitute other fruits such as peaches berries or pears for the apples History Apple crisp is a relatively modern dish It is notably absent from the first edition of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook  which is a comprehensive collection of American recipes The earliest reference to apple crisp in print occurs in  with a recipe in the Everybody s Cook Book A Comprehensive Manual of Home Cookery Isabel Ely Lord  p  In  apple crisp also makes an appearance in a newspaper article in the Appleton Post Crescent on Tuesday December   Appleton Wisconsin Its popularity further spread during World War II when food rationing limited access to pastry ingredients used for making apple pies Despite its relatively recent invention apple crisp or crumble has become an American and British tradition especially during the autumn when apples are plentiful The dish is also very popular in Canada especially in areas where berries and fruit are readily available Variations of this dish are much older for example a recipe for apple pandowdy is in Miss Corson s Practical American Cookery  Similar dishes An apple crisp dessert There are a number of desserts that employ apples with sweet toppings but none of them are the same as apple crisp making them not so much variants but instead other related apple desserts Apple Brown Betty or apple pudding consists of alternating layers of apples and sweetened buttered bread crumbs or crackers often with a sauce Apple cobbler also known asapple slump apple grunt and apple pandowdy is an old recipe in which the baked apples are topped with a cobbler crust formed of batter pie crust or baking powder biscuit dough The topping may be dropped onto the top of the apples in clumps which have a cobbled appearance thus the name Apple pan dowdy most commonly features a pie crust which is broken dowdied before serving it is a pie not a cobbler A grunt is a cobbler cooked on top of the stove and a slump is fruit and biscuit dumplings which is turned upside down after being baked so that the fruit is slumped into the fruit with a fork Apple crumble is a British pudding similar to the apple crisp that originated during World War II food rationing The crumble topping is made of butter flour and brown sugar rolled together so that it resembles breadcrumbs Care must be taken to balance the correct amount of crumble with the fruit or else the filling may seep through and spoil this crust Crumble is traditionally served with custard but today it is sometimes served with cream or ice cream Crumbles made from apples and sometimes other fruits are also common in Australia New Zealand and Ireland Eve s pudding is a British dessert that is essentially a sponge cake atop the apples The name may originate from the biblical reference to Eve and the apple in the

PAServing temperatureColdMain ingredientsVanilla chocolate and strawberry ice cream bananasIngredients generally usedWhipped cream maraschino cherryVariationsCaramel topping strawberry topping pineapple topping chocolate syrup nuts A banana split is an American ice cream based dessert consisting of a peeled banana cut in half lengthwise and served with ice cream and sauce between the two pieces There are many variations but the classic banana split is made with three scoops of ice cream one each of vanilla chocolate and strawberry A sauce or sauces chocolate strawberry and pineapple are traditional are drizzled onto the ice cream which is topped with whipped cream and maraschino cherries Crushed nuts generally peanuts or walnuts are optional Description The original banana split was made with three scoops of different flavored ice creams topped with fruits and served over a banana that was split vertically down the middle The original recipe used strawberries raspberries and crushed pineapple with marshmallow syrup chopped nuts and pitted black cherries The banana split is traditionally served in an elongated glass dish called a boat Strickler s marshmallow sauce is no longer used as a topping The traditional toppings used in today s banana split include pineapple strawberry and chocolate sauce whipped cream nuts and cherries Caramel sauce on the other hand is a non traditional topping used in later variations of the classic banana split Variations on the classic may use grilled bananas experiment with different flavors of ice cream such as coconut or coffee or sauces like salted caramel and warm butterscotch History Banana splits and ice cream sundaes served at a soda fountain at the st U S General Hospital in Paris during World War II Cold beverages and ice cream were a novelty in the mid s when soda fountains began selling ice cream concoctions A popular recipe published in  called for a lengthwise split banana two scoops of ice cream at each end and a spoon of whipped cream in between with maraschino cherries on top with one end covered with chopped mixed nuts and another with chopped mixed fruits The Spatula Soda Water Guide published in  contained recipes for  banana split varieties The origin of the banana split is disputed but most historians believe it was first created in  by an optometrist in Latrobe Pennsylvania named David Doc Strickler Strickler was inspired by the fruit laden sundaes he saw while vacationing in Atlantic City in the summer of  and aspired to create something similar when he returned to Latrobe using the banana fruit which in those days was shipped to Pennsylvania by way of New Orleans The sundae he concocted originally cost  cents twice the price of other sundaes and caught on with students of nearby Saint Vincent College News of a new variety of sundae quickly spread by word of mouth and through correspondence and soon progressed far beyond Latrobe Strickler went on to buy the pharmacy naming it Strickler s Pharmacy while keeping his office on a top floor Wilmington Ohio also claims an early connection dating to  when Ernest Doc Hazard created a dessert in hopes of attracting students from Wilmington College to his shop during the slow days of winter The dessert he came up with was the banana split three scoops of ice cream served between the two halves of a split banana topped with chocolate strawberry and pineapple sauces whipped cream maraschino cherries and nuts However most historians believe the evidence for Strickler s  debut is more convincing and in  the National Ice Cream Retailers Association NICRA certified the city of Latrobe Pennsylvania as the birthplace of the banana split Both towns hold an annual festival in honor of the dessert Banana royale shown topped with banana slices Latrobe and Wilmington are not the only towns to claim the distinction of inventing the banana split In Boston it is said the dessert was created at the Butler Department Store by the head soda jerk who in  served a banana split with two scoops of vanilla ice cream topped with peaches walnuts and pistachios Davenport Iowa claims it was invented by a local Davenport confectioner in  and similar claims have been made by Columbus Ohio where the banana split is said to have been created by Letty Lally when a customer at Foeller s Drug Store asked for something different Food writer Mike Turback considers Lally s creation the first banana royale a sundae made with banana slices The lack of evidence presents an obstacle to proving any of these claims Walgreens is credited with spreading the popularity of the banana split The early drug stores operated by Charles Rudolph Walgreen in the Chicago area adopted the banana split as a signature dessert Fountains in the stores proved to be a draw attracting customers who might otherwise have been just as satisfied having their prescriptions filled at some other drug store in the neighborhood Banana split pie The banana split pie was created by Janet Winquest a  year old resident of Holdrege Nebraska In  she won a   prize in Pillsbury s Grand National Recipe and Baking Contest for the recipe In popular culture Louis Prima played a song called Banana Split for My Baby at the Casbar Lounge of the Sahara Hotel in  The banana split is reputed to have inspired the longstanding debate between residents of the counties of Devon and Cornwall in England about how to correctly assemble a traditional cream tea With food rationing imposed after WW ice cream was in short supply so the split s usual ingredients were partly replaced by locally grown scones Local traditions developed quickly within each county about how best to meet the tastes of their respective tourist trade leading to differing applications of the cream in the assembly of the dish This situation was famously satirised in a BBC s mockumentary Bunfight at the O K Tea Rooms This divergence continues into the modern day See also Food portal List of

Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey depending on their density Brownies often but not always have a glossy skin on their upper crust They may also include nuts frosting chocolate chips or other ingredients A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the th century and popularized there during the first half of the th century Brownies are typically eaten by hand and may be accompanied by a glass of milk served warm with ice cream la mode topped with whipped cream or sprinkled with powdered sugar In North America they are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants ice cream parlors and coffeehouses History One legend about the creation of brownies is that of Bertha Palmer a prominent Chicago socialite whose husband owned the Palmer House Hotel In  Palmer asked a pastry chef for a dessert suitable for ladies attending the Chicago World s Columbian Exposition She requested a dessert that would be smaller than a piece of cake and easily eaten from boxed lunches The result was the Palmer House Brownie made of chocolate with walnuts and an apricot glaze The Palmer House in Chicago still serves this dessert to patrons made from the same recipe The name was given to the dessert some time after  but was not used by cook books or journals at the time Mixing melted butter with chocolate to make a chocolate brownie The first known printed use of the word brownie to describe a dessert appeared in the  version of the Boston Cooking School Cook Book by Fannie Farmer in reference to molasses cakes baked individually in tin molds However Farmer s brownies did not contain chocolate In  the first known recipe was published in Machias Cookbook They were called Brownie s Food The recipe appears on page  in the cake section of the book Marie Kelley from Whitewater Wisconsin created the recipe The earliest known published recipes for a modern style chocolate brownie appeared in Home Cookery  Laconia NH the Service Club Cook Book  Chicago IL The Boston Globe April   p  and the  edition of Fannie Farmer s cookbook These recipes produced a relatively mild and cake like brownie By  the brownie was well established in a recognizable form appearing in Lowney s Cook Book by Maria Willet Howard published by Walter M Lowney Company Boston as an adaptation of the Boston Cooking School recipe for a Bangor Brownie It added an extra egg and an additional square of chocolate creating a richer fudgier dessert The name Bangor Brownie appears to have been derived from the town of Bangor Maine which an apocryphal story states was the hometown of a housewife who created the original brownie recipe Maine food educator and columnist Mildred Brown Schrumpf was the main proponent of the theory that brownies were invented in Bangor While The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink  refuted Schrumpf s premise that Bangor housewives had created the brownie citing the publication of a brownie recipe in a  Fannie Farmer cookbook in its second edition The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America  said it had discovered evidence to support Schrumpf s claim in the form of several  cookbooks that included a recipe for Bangor Brownies In  the food science journalist and home cookery YouTuber Adam Ragusea conducted a series of experiments to discover why modern brownies tend to form a desirably glossy skin on their upper crust In a video reporting his findings Ragusea asserted that the skin was the result of making a batter of high viscosity with low levels of moisture and sugar well dissolved into the mixture See also List of baked

garnished with PeepsTypeCakeCourseDessertPlace of originUnited StatesRegion or stateSouthern statesMain ingredientsWhite or yellow cake icing coconut flakesVariationsCoconut poke cake Coconut cake is a popular dessert in the Southern region of the United States It is a cake frosted with a white frosting and covered in coconut flakes Varieties Typically the cakes used in coconut cake are either white or yellow cakes While some recipes do not call for coconut flavor in the cake itself there are others that replace the milk with coconut milk and or use coconut extract It is also common to brush the cakes with a simple syrup to make it more moist Often the cake layers are filled with either a white frosting or coconut pastry cream Traditionally the cake is frosted with a  minute frosting but cream cheese icings and buttercreams are not uncommon Like the cakes coconut flavor is not always a must in the frosting One constant characteristic of coconut cake is the use of shredded coconut often toasted and or sweetened to cover the frosting One popular variation of coconut cake is coconut poke cake While traditional coconut cake is round and multi layered coconut poke cake is either a white or yellow cake that is rectangular and single layered What makes it a poke cake are the holes made into the cake to act as pores to absorb a coconut liquid mixture or cream of coconut such as CoCo Lopez Afterwards the cake is frosted with a whipped topping Many Southerners also make non traditional versions of coconut cake One popular variation is to pair the coconut with other flavors particularly by filling the cake with a lemon curd to add a tart flavor to a usually very sweet cake Red velvet cake another cake popular in the South will sometimes have shredded coconut

cupcake with strawberry icing and chocolate cupcake with chocolate icingAlternative namesFairy cake patty cake cup cakeTypeCakePlace of originUnited StatesMain ingredientsButter sugar eggs flour optionally frosting and other cake decorations Media Cupcake A cupcake AmE fairy cake BrE or bun IrE is a small cake designed to serve one person which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup As with larger cakes frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied History Unfrosted cupcakes The earliest extant description of what is now often called a cupcake was in  when a recipe for a light cake to bake in small cups was written in American Cookery by Amelia Simmons The earliest extant documentation of the term cupcake itself was in Seventy five Receipts for Pastry Cakes and Sweetmeats in  in Eliza Leslie s Receipts cookbook In the early th century there were two different uses for the term cup cake or cupcake In previous centuries before muffin tins were widely available the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups ramekins or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked in This is the use of the name that has remained and the name of cupcake is now given to any small round cake that is about the size of a teacup While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcake they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate frosting The other kind of cup cake referred to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume using a standard sized cup instead of being weighed Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard sized cup could also be baked in cups however they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves In later years when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens these recipes became known as  cakes or quarter cakes so called because they are made up of four ingredients one cup of butter two cups of sugar three cups of flour and four eggs They are plain yellow cakes somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake due to using about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker cup cake uses a volume measurement and pound cake uses a weight measurement Recipes A mass produced Hostess CupCake a typical snack cake style of cupcake A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard sized cakes butter sugar eggs and flour Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in such as raisins berries nuts or chocolate chips Because their small size is more efficient for heat conduction cupcakes bake much faster than a normal layered cake During baking the volume of the batter initially increases due to the production of carbon dioxide then decreases upon cooling due to the release of leavening gases Cupcakes may be topped with frosting or other cake decorations Elaborately decorated cupcakes may be made for special occasions They may be filled with frosting fruit or pastry cream For bakers making a small number of filled cupcakes this is usually accomplished by using a spoon or knife to scoop a small hole in the top of the cupcake Another method is to just insert the pastry bag in the middle of the cupcake In commercial bakeries the filling may be injected using a syringe Variants A cake in a mug more commonly known as a mug cake is a variant that gained popularity on many Internet cooking forums and mailing lists The technique uses a mug as its cooking vessel and can be done in a microwave oven The recipe often takes fewer than five minutes to prepare A cake in a jar a glass jar is used instead of mugs trays or liners A butterfly cake is a variant of cupcake also called fairy cake for its fairy like wings The top of the cake is separated and split in half A filling e g icing or jam is placed into the hole The two halves are placed onto the filling to resemble wings Other decorations such as sprinkles and icing sugar are often added over the cake Elaborately frosted cupcakes may be made for special occasions such as baby showers graduations or holidays A cake ball or cake pop is an individual portion of cake round like a chocolate truffle that is coated in chocolate These are typically formed from crumbled cake mixed with frosting rather than being baked as a sphere A gourmet cupcake is a recent variant of cupcake Gourmet cupcakes are large and filled cupcakes based around a variety of flavor themes such as Tiramisu or Cappuccino In recent years there has been an increase in stores that sell only gourmet cupcakes As an alternative to a plate of individual cakes some bakers place standard cupcakes into a pattern and frost them to create a large design such as a basket of flowers or a turtle Examples of cupcake variations A mug cake Cake in a jar A butterfly cake Elaborately decorated A cake ball Gourmet cupcake s mores flavor Large design Pans and liners A cupcake pan made of tinned steel Originally cupcakes were baked in heavy pottery cups Some bakers still use individual ramekins small coffee mugs large tea cups or other small ovenproof pottery type dishes for baking cupcakes Cupcakes are usually baked in muffin tins These pans are most often made from metal with or without a non stick surface and generally have six or twelve depressions or cups They may also be made from stoneware silicone rubber or other materials A standard size cup is  inches  mm in diameter and holds about  ounces  g although pans for both miniature and jumbo size cupcakes exist Specialty pans may offer many different sizes and shapes Cupcakes may be plain cakes without any frosting or other decoration These were baked on a flat baking sheet in a double layer of paper cupcake liners Individual patty cases or cupcake liners may be used in baking These are typically round sheets of thin paper pressed into a round fluted cup shape Liners can facilitate the easy removal of the cupcake from the tin after baking keep the cupcake more moist and reduce the effort needed to clean the pan The use of liners is also considered a more sanitary option when cupcakes are being passed from hand to hand Like cupcake pans several sizes of paper liners are available from miniature to jumbo In addition to paper cupcake liners may be made from very thin aluminum foil or in a reusable version silicone rubber Because they can stand up on their own foil and silicone liners can also be used on a flat baking sheet which makes them popular among people who do not have a specialized muffin tin Some of the largest paper liners are not fluted and are made out of thicker paper often rolled at the top edge for additional strength so that they can also stand independently for baking without a cupcake tin Some bakers use two or three thin paper liners nested together to simulate the strength of a single foil cup Liners which are also called paper cases come in a variety of sizes Slightly different sizes are considered standard in different countries Miniature cases are commonly  to  millimetres   to   in in diameter at the base and  millimetres   in tall Standard size cases range from  to  millimetres   to   in in diameter at the base and are  to  millimetres   to   in tall Australian and Swedish bakers are accustomed to taller paper cases with a larger diameter at the top than American and British bakers The cupcone is a cupcake baked directly in an edible flat bottomed ice cream cone Shops A cupcake shop in New Orleans Louisiana In the early st century a trend for cupcake shops which are specialized bakeries that sell little or nothing except cupcakes developed in the United States playing off of the sense of nostalgia evoked by the cakes In New York City cupcake shops like Magnolia Bakery gained publicity in their appearances on popular television shows like HBO s Sex and the City Crumbs Bake Shop a publicly traded business running the largest cupcake shop chain in the U S reached its peak stock price in  Declining sales due to competition from locally owned mom and pop specialty stores as well as increased competition from grocery stores caused a sharp decline in the company s prospects and stock price in  Georgetown Cupcake was the first cupcakery to open in Washington D C The cupcake shop gained widespread publicity after the  premier of TLC s DC Cupcakes a

judge on the Food Network s Cupcake Wars and her husband Charles Nelson Sprinkles is the first cupcake shop to debut a cupcake ATM which could hold up to  cupcakes at one time Themes Periodic Table of CupcakesCupcakes are sometimes used to celebrate and illustrate specific events or themes Popular themes include unicorns and mermaids Holiday themed cupcakes such as reindeer at Christmas are popular in grocery stores Among educational themes a periodic table of cupcakes is a collection of decorated cupcakes arranged in order to represent the atomic elements of the periodic table The cupcakes are usually frosted with the appropriate atomic number and chemical symbol The first person to bake and ice a set of cupcakes organized and colored to represent the elements of the periodic table was Ida Freund in  The first woman to hold a post as a university chemistry lecturer in the UK Freund used the cupcakes as a pedagogical tool to engage and amuse her female students at Cambridge University

ingredientsGround beef patty cheese bun Media Cheeseburger A cheeseburger is a hamburger with a slice of melted cheese on top of the meat patty added near the end of the cooking time Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure ingredients and composition As with other hamburgers a cheeseburger may include various condiments and other toppings such as lettuce tomato onion pickles bacon avocado mushrooms mayonnaise ketchup and mustard In fast food restaurants across the United States processed cheese is usually used although other meltable cheeses are used such as cheddar Swiss mozzarella blue cheese or pepper jack Virtually all restaurants that sell hamburgers also offer cheeseburgers Origins By the late th century the vast grasslands of the Great Plains had been opened up for cattle ranching This made it possible for many Americans to consume beef almost daily The hamburger remains as one of the cheapest forms of beef in America Adding cheese to hamburgers became popular in  There are several competing claims as to who created the first cheeseburger Lionel Sternberger is reputed to have introduced the cheeseburger in  at the age of  He was working as a fry cook at his father s Pasadena California sandwich shop The Rite Spot and experimentally dropped a slab of American cheese on a sizzling hamburger An early example of the cheeseburger appearing on a menu is a  menu for the Los Angeles restaurant O Dell s which listed a cheeseburger smothered with chili for  cents Other restaurants also claim to have invented the cheeseburger For example Kaelin s Restaurant in Louisville Kentucky said it invented the cheeseburger in  One year later a trademark for the name cheeseburger was awarded to Louis Ballast of the Humpty Dumpty Drive In in Denver Colorado According to Steak n Shake archives the restaurant s founder Gus Belt applied for a trademark on the word in the s An A W Restaurants franchise in Lansing Michigan is credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger in  putting it on the menu after repeated requests from the same customer The steamed cheeseburger a variation almost exclusively served in central Connecticut is believed to have been invented at a restaurant called Jack s Lunch in Middletown Connecticut in the s The largest cheeseburger ever made weighed   pounds  kg It is said to have included  pounds  kg of bacon  pounds  kg of lettuce  pounds  kg of sliced onions  pounds  kg of pickles and  pounds  kg of cheese This record was set in  by Minnesota s Black Bear Casino smashing the previous record of  pounds  kg In the United States National Cheeseburger Day is celebrated annually on September  Ingredients Some cheeseburger ingredients The ingredients used to create cheeseburgers follow similar patterns found in the regional variations of hamburgers although most start with ground beef Common cheeses used for topping are American Swiss Cheddar and other meltable cheeses Popular toppings include lettuce tomato onion pickles bacon avocado or guacamole sliced saut ed mushrooms cheese sauce or chili but the variety of possible toppings is broad A cheeseburger may have more than one patty or more than one slice of cheese it is reasonably common but by no means automatic for the number to increase at the same rate with cheese and meat interleaved A stack of two or more patties follows the same basic pattern as hamburgers with two patties will be called a double cheeseburger a triple cheeseburger has three and while much less common a quadruple has four Sometimes cheeseburgers are prepared with the cheese enclosed within the ground beef rather than on top This is sometimes known as a Jucy Lucy Gallery A Burger King Quad Stacker cheeseburger containing four patties and bacon A cheeseburger at a

restaurant Ptomaine Tommy s located in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles Ptomaine Tommy s was open from around  to  where his chili burger was referred to as size and chopped onions as flowers or violets The term size for a chili burger arguably derives from the portion size of the chili used at Ptomaine Tommy s Ptomaine Tommy had two ladles a large and a small with which to serve his chili whether smothered on top of the burger or in a bowl originally the ordering lingo used by his patrons was hamburger size vs steak size but later simplified to size and oversize The use of

property to satisfy creditors and he died just a week later His service to the community and his invention was noted by resolution of the California State Senate that same year Food author John T Edge

interviewing former customers and friends decades after the fact columnist Jack Smith wrote a definitive article in  about DeForest and the dish that he had invented which became a very important part

or bread roll Hamburgers are often served with cheese lettuce tomato onion pickles bacon or chilis condiments such as ketchup mustard mayonnaise relish or a special sauce often a variation of Thousand Island dressing and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger Hamburgers are often sold at fast food restaurants and diners but are also sold at various other restaurants There are many international and regional variations of hamburger Some of the largest multinational fast food chains have a burger as one of their core products McDonald s Big Mac and Burger King s Whopper have become global icons of American culture Etymology and terminology The term hamburger originally derives from Hamburg the second largest city in Germany however there is no certain connection between the food and the city By rebracketing the term burger eventually became a self standing word that is associated with many different types of sandwiches similar to a ground meat hamburger but made of different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger venison kangaroo chicken turkey elk lamb or fish such as salmon in the salmon burger and even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own Since the term hamburger usually implies beef for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used as in beef burger turkey burger bison burger portobello burger or veggie burger In many English speaking countries outside the United States including the United Kingdom Ireland Canada Australia and New Zealand a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich but in Commonwealth English a sandwich typically requires sliced bread and anything with a bun is usually considered a burger History Main articles History of the hamburger and History of the hamburger in the United States Hamburg steak has been known as Frikadelle in Germany since the th century The Hamburger Rundst ck was popular already in  and is believed to be a precursor to the modern Hamburger Cheeseburger with onions and tomatoes at Louis Lunch New Haven Connecticut Versions of the meal have been served for over a century but its origins remain obscure The  edition of the book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse included a recipe called Hamburgh sausage suggesting that it should be served roasted with toasted bread under it A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg under the name of Rundst ck warm bread roll warm in  or earlier and was supposedly eaten by emigrants on their way to America However this may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadelle It has alternatively been suggested that Hamburg steak served between two pieces of bread and eaten by Jewish passengers travelling from Hamburg to New York on Hamburg America Line vessels which began operations in  became so well known that the shipping company gave its name to the dish It is not known which of these stories actually marks the invention of the hamburger and explains the name There is a reference to a Hamburg steak as early as  in the Boston Journal On July   the Chicago Daily Tribune made a highly specific claim regarding a hamburger sandwich in an article about a Sandwich Car A distinguished favorite only five cents is Hamburger steak sandwich the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and cooked while you wait on the gasoline range Claims of invention The origin of the hamburger is unclear though hamburger steak sandwiches have been advertised in U S newspapers from New York to Hawaii since at least the s The invention of hamburgers is commonly attributed to various people including Charlie Nagreen Frank and Charles Menches Oscar Weber Bilby Fletcher Davis or Louis Lassen White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase Some have pointed to a recipe for Hamburgh sausages on toasted bread published in The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse in  Hamburgers gained national recognition in the U S at the  St Louis World s Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as the innovation of a food vendor on the pike No conclusive argument has ended the dispute over invention An article from ABC News sums up One problem is that there is little written history Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World s Fair from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country Louis Lassen Although debunked by The Washington Post a popular myth recorded by Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro stated the first hamburger served in America was by Louis Lassen a Danish immigrant after he opened Louis Lunch in New Haven in  Louis Lunch a small lunch wagon in New Haven Connecticut is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U S in  New York Magazine states that The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later also noting that this claim is subject to dispute A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks Taking ground beef trimmings Louis made a patty and grilled it putting it between two slices of toast Some critics such as Josh Ozersky a food editor for New York Magazine claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted Charlie Nagreen One of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen who in  sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour Wisconsin credits Nagreen now known as Hamburger Charlie with the invention Nagreen was  when he reportedly sold pork sandwiches at the  Seymour Fair made so customers could eat while walking The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar Otto Kuase According to White Castle Otto Kuase was the inventor of the hamburger In  he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg German sailors later omitted the fried egg Oscar Weber Bilby The family of Oscar Weber Bilby claims the first known hamburger on a bun was served on July   on Grandpa Oscar s farm The bun was a yeast bun In  Governor Frank Keating proclaimed that the first true hamburger on a bun was created and consumed in Tulsa Oklahoma in  calling Tulsa The Real Birthplace of the Hamburger Frank and Charles Menches A bacon cheeseburger from a New York City diner Frank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in  in Hamburg New York During the fair they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef The brothers exhausted their supply of sausage so they purchased chopped up beef from a butcher Andrew Klein Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein s market not Klein s despite Stein s having sold the market in  The story notes that the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg New York not Hamburg Germany Frank Menches s obituary in The New York Times states that these events took place at the  Summit County Fair in Akron Ohio Fletcher Davis Fletcher Davis of Athens Texas claimed to have invented the hamburger According to oral histories in the s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a burger of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread with a pickle on the side The story is that in  Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St Louis World s Fair Historian Frank X Tolbert noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the s with Fletcher Old Dave Davis A photo of Old Dave s Hamburger Stand from  was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim Other hamburger steak claims Various non specific claims of the invention relate to the term hamburger steak without mention of its being a sandwich The first printed American menu which listed hamburger is said to be an  menu from Delmonico s in New York However the printer of the original menu was not in business in  In  a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item Between  and  Hamburg Beefsteak was on the Breakfast and Supper Menu of the Clipper Restaurant at   Pacific Street in San Fernando California It cost

and the same big two chains dominate the High Street as in the U S McDonald s and Burger King The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK In Ireland the food outlet Supermacs is widespread throughout the country serving burgers as part of its menu In Ireland Abrakebabra started out selling kebabs and Eddie Rocket s are also major chains An original and indigenous rival to the big two U S giants was the quintessentially British fast food chain Wimpy originally known as Wimpy Bar opened  at the Lyon s Corner House in Coventry Street London which served its hamburgers on a plate with British style chips accompanied by cutlery and delivered to the customer s table In the late s to compete with McDonald s Wimpy began to open American style counter service restaurants and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re branded as Burger Kings between  and  by the then owner of both brands Grand Metropolitan A management buyout in  split the brands again and now Wimpy table service restaurants can still be found in many town centres whilst new counter service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations Hamburgers are also available from mobile kiosks commonly known as burger vans particularly at outdoor events such as football matches Burgers from this type of outlet are usually served without any form of salad only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup mustard or brown sauce Chip shops particularly in the West Midlands and North East of England Scotland and Ireland serve battered hamburgers called batter burgers This is where the burger patty is deep fat fried in batter and is usually served with chips Hamburgers and veggie burgers served with chips and salad is standard pub grub menu items Many pubs specialize in gourmet burgers These are usually high quality minced steak patties topped with things such as blue cheese brie avocado anchovy mayonnaise

pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased These burgers are served similarly to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce mint sauce and plum sauce In the early st century premium hamburger chains and independent restaurants have arisen selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often organic usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take away Chains include Gourmet Burger Kitchen Ultimate Burger Hamburger Union and Byron Hamburgers in London Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty

food restaurant in Auckland New Zealand contains beetroot for flavor Fast food franchises sell American style fast food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand The traditional Australasian hamburgers are usually bought from fish and chip shops or milk bars rather than from chain restaurants These traditional hamburgers are becoming less common as older style fast food outlets decrease in number The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef or mince as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand They commonly include tomato lettuce grilled onion and meat as minimum in this form known in Australia as a plain hamburger which often also includes a slice of beetroot and optionally can include cheese beetroot pineapple a fried egg and bacon If all these optional ingredients are included it is known in Australia as a burger with the lot In Australia and New Zealand as in the United Kingdom the word sandwich is generally reserved for two slices of bread from a loaf with fillings in between them unlike in American English where a sandwich is fillings between two pieces of any kind of bread not only slices of bread as such burgers are not generally considered to be sandwiches The term burger is applied to any cut bun with a hot filling even when the filling does not contain beef such as a chicken burger generally with chicken breast rather than chicken mince salmon burger pulled pork burger veggie burger etc The only variance between the two countries hamburgers is that New Zealand s equivalent to The Lot often contains a steak beef The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and tomato sauce The traditional Australasian hamburger never includes mayonnaise The McDonald s McOz Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger however it is no longer a part of the menu Likewise McDonald s in New Zealand created a Kiwiburger similar to a Quarter Pounder but features salad beetroot and a fried egg The Hungry Jack s Burger King Aussie Burger has tomato lettuce onion cheese bacon beetroot egg ketchup and a meat patty while adding pineapple is an upcharge It is essentially a Burger with the lot but uses the standard HJ circular breakfast Egg rather than the fully fried egg used by local fish shops China Roujiamo the Chinese hamburger In China due to the branding of their sandwiches by McDonald s and KFC restaurants in China the word burger refers to all sandwiches that consist of two pieces of bun and a meat patty in between This has led to confusion when Chinese nationals try to order sandwiches with meat fillings other than beef in fast food restaurants in North America A popular Chinese street food known as roujiamo consists of meat most commonly pork sandwiched between two buns Roujiamo has been called the Chinese hamburger Since the sandwich dates back to the Qin dynasty   BC and fits the aforementioned Chinese word for burger

mixed with minced onions eggs breadcrumbs and spices They are served with brown sauce or demi glace in restaurants with vegetable or salad sides or occasionally in Japanese curries Hamburgers may be served in casual western style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as family restaurants On the other hand Hamburgers in buns are predominantly the domain of fast food chains Japan has homegrown hamburger chain restaurants such as MOS Burger First Kitchen and Freshness Burger Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include teriyaki burgers katsu burgers containing tonkatsu and burgers containing shrimp korokke Some of the more unusual examples include the rice burger where the bun is made of rice and the luxury   yen US  Takumi Burger meaning artisan taste featuring avocados

Japan also recently launched a McPork burger made with US pork McDonald s has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains due partly to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined upscale hamburger offerings Burger King once retreated from Japan but re entered the market in summer  in cooperation with the Korean owned Japanese fast food chain Lotteria Denmark The modern Danish b fsandwich In Denmark the hamburger was introduced in  though it was called the b fsandwich There are many variations While the original b fsandwich was simply a generic meat patty containing a mix of beef and horse meat with slightly different garnish mustard ketchup and soft onions it has continued to evolve Today a b fsandwich usually contains a beef patty pickled cucumber raw pickled fried and or soft onions pickled red beets mustard ketchup remoulade and perhaps most strikingly is often overflowing with brown gravy which is sometimes even poured on top of the assembled b fsandwich The original b fsandwich is still on the menu at the same restaurant from which it originated in  now run by the original owner s grandson Following the popularity of the b fsandwich many variations sprung up using different types of meat instead of the beef patty One variation the fl skestegssandwich grew especially popular This variation replaces the minced beef patty with slices of pork loin or belly and typically uses sweet and sour pickled red cabbage mayonnaise mustard and pork rinds as garnish Today the b fsandwich fl skestegssandwich and their many variations co exist with the more typical hamburger with the opening of the first Burger King restaurant in  popularizing the original dish in Denmark Many local high end burger restaurants

vegetables and ground meat Open hamburger with cheese and fries served in an American diner Evidence suggests that either the United States or Germany the city of Hamburg was the first country where two slices of bread and a ground beef patty were combined into a hamburger sandwich and sold There is some controversy over the origin of the hamburger because its two basic ingredients bread and beef had been prepared and consumed separately for many years in both countries before their combination Shortly after its creation the hamburger quickly included all of its currently typically characteristic trimmings including onions lettuce and sliced pickles After various controversies in the th century including a nutritional controversy in the late s the burger is now readily identified with the United States and a particular style of cuisine namely fast food Along with fried chicken and apple pie the hamburger has become a culinary icon in the United States The hamburger s international popularity is the result of the larger globalization of food that also includes the rise in global popularity of other national dishes including the Italian pizza Chinese fried rice and Japanese sushi The hamburger has spread from continent to continent perhaps because it matches familiar elements in different culinary cultures This global culinary culture has been produced in part by the concept of selling processed food first launched in the s by the White Castle restaurant chain and its founder Edgar Waldo Billy Ingram and then refined by McDonald s in the s This global expansion provides economic points of comparison like the Big Mac Index by which one can compare the purchasing power of different countries where the Big Mac hamburger is sold Beginning A french steak tartare Hamburg steak has been known by the name Frikadelle in Germany since at least the th century The Hamburger Rundst ck was popular already in  and is believed to be a precursor to the modern hamburger Before the disputed invention of the hamburger in the United States similar foods already existed in the culinary tradition of Europe The Apicius cookbook a collection of ancient Roman recipes that may date to the early th century details a preparation of beef called isicia omentata served as a baked patty in which beef is mixed with pine kernels black and green peppercorns and white wine isicia omentata may be the earliest precursor to the hamburger It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared While not providing a clear name the first description of steak tartare was given by Jules Verne in  in his novel Michael Strogoff There are certain similarities between steak tartare and the German dishes Labskaus and Mett Other similar raw chopped meats appeared in the th century One of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in  in Hannah Glasse s Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy Hamburgh Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices including nutmeg cloves black pepper garlic and salt and is typically served with toast Other dishes are also made with minced meat such as meatloaf the Serbian pljeskavica the Arab kofta and meatballs The word sandwich was not recorded until the th century Many cultures claim invention of the sandwich but it was given its name around the year  in honor of the English aristocrat John Montagu th Earl of Sandwich who preferred to eat sandwiches so he could play cards without soiling his fingers In  Elizabeth Leslie Cook included a sandwich recipe in her cookbook and it appeared in the local cuisine of the United States Hamburg and its port The port of Hamburg in the s Minced meat was a delicacy in medieval cuisine red meat usually being restricted to the higher classes Very little mincing was done by medieval butchers or recorded in the cookbooks of the time perhaps because it was not part of the sausage making process that preserves meat During the first half of the th century most European emigrants to the New World embarked from Hamburg and New York City was their most common destination Restaurants in New York offered Hamburg style American fillet or even beefsteak la Hambourgeoise Early American preparations of minced beef were therefore made to fit the tastes of European immigrants evoking memories of the port of Hamburg and the world they left behind Hamburg steak In the late th century the Hamburg steak became popular on the menus of many restaurants in the port of New York This might consist of a fried patty of chopped beef eggs onions and seasoning or it might be lightly salted and often smoked and served raw in a dish along with onions and bread crumbs The oldest document that refers to the Hamburg steak is a Delmonico s Restaurant menu from  which offered customers an  cent plate of Hamburg steak that had been developed by American chef Charles Ranhofer   This price was high for the time twice the price of a simple fillet of beef steak However by the end of the century the Hamburg steak was gaining popularity because of its ease of preparation decreasing cost This is evident from its detailed description in some of the most popular cookbooks of the day Documents show that this preparation style was used by  in some U S restaurants and was also used for feeding patients in hospitals the Hamburg steak was served raw or lightly cooked and was accompanied by a raw egg The menus of many American restaurants during the th century included a Hamburg beefsteak that was often sold for breakfast A variant of Hamburg steak is the Salisbury steak which is usually served with a gravy similar in texture to brown sauce Invented by Dr James Salisbury   the term Salisbury steak has been used in the United States since  Nowadays in the city of Hamburg as well as in parts of northern Germany this type dish is called Frikadelle Frikandelle or Bulette which is similar to the meatball The term hamburger steak was replaced by hamburger by  which has in turn been somewhat displaced by the simpler term burger The latter term is now commonly used as a suffix to create new words for different variants of the hamburger including cheeseburger porkburger baconburger and mooseburger There are other foods with names derived from German cities that are shortened in different ways in American English An example is the frankfurter often abbreviated as frank Invention William Davies Company stall at the St Lawrence Market in Toronto Canada Scenes such as this became common during the early twentieth century in the United States and Canada as the meat market grew rapidly Many recipes and dishes traveled along with transatlantic immigrants to their destinations in the New World Some authors question whether the Hamburg America Line was part of this arguing that the hamburger was created to meet needs that arose amongst immigrants already in the New World Others however support the thesis that the Hamburg America Line brought the first Hamburger steaks from Europe to the Americas The hamburger as it is known today has multiple invention claims ranging between  and  but it is well established by the early th century During the following  years the hamburger spread throughout the world as a result of the emerging concept of fast food and a new business model the franchise North America See also History of the hamburger in the United States The industrial use of mechanical meat shredding was the technical advance that helped popularize the Hamburg steak The first meat grinder was invented in the early th century by the German engineer Karl Drais The machine made it possible for minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices By  numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable Before this minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots in the minds of many Americans Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods including hot dogs and meatloaf Another development facilitating the invention and popularization of the proto hamburger was the increased production of beef through livestock intensification By the late th century an increasing amount of land was being devoted to cattle and a growing number of people being employed as cowboys resulting in the United States becoming one of the world s largest producers and consumers of beef The s were declared The Golden Age of Beef during which the abundance of rural beef production made vital its transportation by rail from agricultural to urban areas This gave rise to various methods of meat preservation for making possible the consumption of fresh meat in urban and industrialized areas among the refrigerator cars and different methods of packaging meat such as corned beef which were promoted by industrialists like Gustavus Swift   Around this time the city of Chicago along with other cities on the East Coast became a focal point for the large scale processing of beef Beef was already inexpensive at that time and it was available to the working class This put the Hamburg steak within reach of the vast majority of the population giving rise to what some authors jokingly call the American beef dream In this era the number of steakhouses that specialized in serving steaks increased markedly some restaurants even served steak along with seafood in a dish known as Surf and turf The high production and consumption of beef cattle in the United States made the meat industry increasingly powerful by the end of the th century Corruption problems soon arose in the meat industry problems that endangered both quality and hygiene At the beginning of the th century Upton Sinclair published The Jungle a novel about conspiracies and corruption in the American meat industry intended as a veiled criticism of the industry itself The book raised popular awareness about the safety of meat processing and helped lead to the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act which was sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration The Jungle was a milestone in the subsequent history of the hamburger as it led the American public to force restaurant chains to prove the safety of their cooked meat In  Arthur Kallett published a similar book entitled  million guinea pigs Dangers in Everyday foods drugs and cosmetics which warned consumers specifically about the content preservatives in hamburgers Controversial origins The Big Mac popularized an evolution in the image of the hamburger Many people have claimed to have invented the hamburger as a sandwich of a ground beef patty placed between two slices of bread All claims for invention occur between  and  making it probable that the hamburger was created sometime in these two decades Despite varieties common elements in these narratives include the claim that the hamburger was born as a food associated with major events such as amusement parks fairs conferences and festivals These hypotheses also often share the presence of street vendors James A Cockrell editor of the St Louis Globe Democrat states that In St Louis I ve heard from person whose parents or grandparents came from the southern regions of Germany say that northern Germans in the city of Hamburg were much given to eating ground meat even in the distant past Other Germans disapproved of the Hamburg ground meat freaks especially the Hamburg types who liked raw ground meat So the St Louis Germans may have named the sandwich hamburger as a derisive gesture toward the barbaric ground meat gobblers in the city of Hamburg It is certain that the people of Hamburg never got around to making a ground meat sandwich If they did it never caught on over there One of the first birth of the burger stories belongs to Canton Ohio natives Frank and Charles Menches who were food vendors at the  Erie County Fair outside of Buffalo New York also known as the Hamburg Fair According to this story during the Fair the Menches ran out of their signature menu item of pork sausage sandwiches Their local supplier butcher Andrew Klein was reluctant to butcher more hogs during a period of unseasonable late summer heat and suggested to substitute the use of ground beef The brothers fired some up but both found it dry and bland They added coffee brown sugar and other ingredients to create a unique taste The original sandwiches were sold with just ketchup and sliced onions With new found success with their beef sandwich they named it the hamburger after the Erie County Fair s home town of Hamburg New York National Birth of the Burger Day is celebrated on September  to honor the invention of the burger in  at the Hamburg Fair In the s carnival historian John C Kunzog interviewed Frank Menches about his experience at the Erie County Fair His detailed hamburger story was published in this book Tanbark Tinsel published in  Another possible inventor of the hamburger is Charlie Nagreen   of Seymour Wisconsin who at the age of  sold Hamburg steaks from a street stall at the annual Outagamie County Fair Nagreen said he began by selling Hamburg steaks but these did not have much success because people wanted to freely move around the festival without the need to eat them at his stand In response to this in  Nagreen decided to flatten the hamburger steak and insert it between two slices of bread so that the public could move freely from booth to booth while eating his sandwich an innovation that was well received by his customers This became known as the Hamburger Charlie and Nagreen s creation was sold at the festival until his death in  To this day his accomplishment is celebrated annually with a Burger Fest in his honor in his hometown of Seymour Another alleged inventor of the hamburger is the cook Fletcher Davis better known as Old Dave who claimed to have had the idea of putting ground beef between two pieces of Texas Toast when one of his customers was in too much of a hurry to sit down for a meal The customer walked away with his Hamburger Steak and seemed so content that Old Dave offered his new carryout meal as a staple menu item at the end of  in Athens Texas Fletcher had a stall with his wife at the St Louis World s Fair of  Texan journalist Frank X Tolbert mentions a salesman named Fletcher Davis who served hamburgers in a caf at  Tyler Street in Athens during the late s The locals claim that Davis was selling beef sandwiches during that time without having a clear name for his invention During the s the Dairy Queen ice cream chain filmed a documentary about the birthplace of the hamburger featuring Davis story The story of Old Dave s Hamburger Sandwich is also found mentioned in Ronald L McDonald s book The Complete Hamburger Another version of the creation of the hamburger is that of German cook Otto Kuase who created a very popular sailors sandwich made of a fillet of beef patty fried in butter served with a fried egg between two toasted buns in  at a post in Hamburg Germany The sandwich was called the Deutsches Beefsteak German for German beefsteak Many of the sailors traveling on ships between Hamburg and New York requested a similar Hamburg style sandwich at American steakhouses There are many additional claims as to the origin of the hamburger Some enthusiasts claim the hamburger could have been created in S o Gon alo a municipality located in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro in the th century by a Chef named Sauerbrown Little Victor but this claim has no supporting evidence to back the opinion A local newspaper claims that Louis Lassen a Danish immigrant who arrived in America in  sold butter and eggs as a street vendor In  in an interview with The New York Times he recounted how he created a hamburger steak sandwich with small strips of beef for a restaurant known as Louis Lunch in New Haven Connecticut Lassen s family claims  as the year of his invention Revealed in a public confrontation between the grandson of Louis Kenneth Davis Lassen Fletch and his uncle documentation signed under notary in  demonstrates the development of the hamburger as it stresses the difference between a hamburger steak and a hamburger sandwich Louis Lunch flame broils the hamburgers in the original vertical cast iron gas stoves manufactured by the Bridge and Beach Co St Louis Missouri in  The stoves use hinged steel wire gridirons to hold the hamburgers in place while they cook simultaneously on both sides The gridirons were made by Luigi Pieragostini and patented in  Ingredients The modern hamburger with its familiar sides French fries and a drink Hamburg steak once served between two slices of bread began to be prepared with a variety of different ingredients that were included either in the sandwich itself or as a side dish accompanying it on a plate One of these accompaniments which is still common with today s burger is ketchup a type of tomato sauce with a blend of flavors between sweet and sour that was first produced commercially in  by entrepreneur and chef Henry John Heinz in Sharpsburg Pennsylvania His company was originally called the Anchor Pickle and Vinegar Works but in  it was renamed F J Heinz The use of ketchup by American consumers grew quickly after this date and it was not long before hamburgers were almost universally accompanied by ketchup by the end of the nineteenth and into the early th century Mustard is a significantly older condiment as it is thought that the ancient Romans used a dressing made with non fermented grapes and grape seeds known as mustum ardens Another ingredient incorporated into the burger mayonnaise appears to have been present in th century France after the naval victory of Louis Fran ois Armand du Plessis de Richelieu in the port of Mah n in Menorca around  Among the vegetables that come with the hamburger the first described in the literature on its history is the onion usually finely sliced in rings Thus the hamburger came to continue the long American tradition of sandwiches featuring some kind of plant product whether that be lettuce as in the case of the BLT sandwich sauerkraut as on the reuben coleslaw or pickles It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting the steak with the bread vegetables were included to give the finished product a more natural appearance and taste All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age the s In some cases the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor as in the case of Tex Mex style burgers which are served with a side of chili con carne French fries are an invention of the Low Countries and Belgian historian Jo Gerard mentions that they originated around  in both Belgium and the Spanish Netherlands specifically in the area of the Meuse valley between Dinant and Li ge The people of this region used to prepare meals with small amounts of fried fish but when the river froze over and fishing became impossible they would cut up potatoes and fry them in animal oil French fries were introduced as a snack in American caf s by the early th century   but they did not become popular until World War II era rationing made them an inexpensive and easily available menu item   Initially however there were safety concerns raised over the fries and the kitchens in which they were prepared leading some companies such as White Castle to remove them from their menus until the s  The improvements in potato freezing technology made by J R Simplot of Idaho City and McDonald s in the s aided the large scale production of French fries Previously the frozen potatoes lost some of their flavor during frying but new processes avoided this inconvenience partly thanks to the use of a mixture of cow tallow and soybean oil   At the end of the th century a new generation of cola emerged a beverage that would soon join beer as the most traditional drinks served alongside the hamburger The first recipe for Coca Cola was invented in  in Columbus Georgia by grocer John Pemberton Originally called coca wine the trademark was Pemberton s French Wine Coca it may have been inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani a European coca wine In the late th century it was sold as a bottled soft drink in most of the United States In the early th century another beverage Pepsi was created by pharmacist Caleb Bradham and quickly came to rival the sales of Coca Cola Strategic alliances between large burger restaurant chains and these two soft drink companies greatly increased the beverages availability to the general public Commercialization A  advertisement for hamburger patties The dawn of the th century witnessed the need to provide food for people living in highly productive urban centers with high population densities Food also had to be economically affordable for the working class in order for them to maintain their labor and industrial production The burger was born in a time when people needed to eat both fast and cheap Technological advances in the field of food preservation as well as improvements in agricultural production and transportation made it possible for hamburgers to be a practical choice of food for urban dwellers since their very creation The socio economic environment of the United States at the time of the burger s rise to popularity coincided with the end of World War I and the beginning of the Great Depression of  This environment was particularly favorable for fostering inexpensive food which was one reason why five cent hamburgers were so popular After its invention during the first decade of the th century the hamburger came to be marketed on a large scale after visionaries realized that it would benefit greatly from a mass production process The first automobile production line was created by Karl Benz in Germany in  The widespread appearance of telephones occurred at the beginning of the th century along with other modern means of communication including radio For the average American who had not eaten in a restaurant in his or her entire life the fast food chains that appeared in the cities offered an alternative form of restaurant in which eating was very much a public activity The concept of a greasy spoon was thus born with these restaurants in which hygiene suffered in exchange for more inexpensive food On the other hand there was a growing interconnected world in which trips by car bus and rail became increasingly available All these means of transport were improving at the time and soon it was necessary to feed a growing population that was in permanent transit frequently moving through different cities on business George Pullman invented the sleeping car and the dining car in response to the needs of these people in the s Similarly the English immigrant Frederick Henry Harvey was the first to use dynamic mass movement in restoring the Fred Harvey Company which catered to the patrons of a chain of hotels located near railway stations as well as offering catering services and high quality products on the trains themselves Contemporary American society also witnessed the creation of new fast foods that originated from the traditional cuisine of various ethnic groups from around the world For example German immigrant Charles Feltman invented the hot dog in  in his stall in Coney Island New York by pairing a frankfurter with a bread bun Imitators such as Harry Magley and Charles Stevens soon began selling hot dogs at New York Polo Grounds baseball games Similarly Italian immigrants sold ice cream from vending carts in the streets or pasta at their restaurants Chinese immigrants initially opened restaurants to cater to their fellow Chinese Americans but they gradually became accepted by the American clientele sometimes resulting in truly Chinese American cuisine such as chop suey In this diverse world of ethnic foods the hamburger was able to rise to mainstream popularity and become a national food of the United States White Castle System Main article White Castle restaurant The  White Castle Building No  in Minneapolis Minnesota On November   chef and entrepreneur Walter Walt Anderson opened a hamburger stand in Wichita Kansas that used hygienic cooking methods including grills and spatulas and impressed his Wichita customers so much that many would become regular patrons At this time the hamburger was still not widely known by the American public Anderson added onion rings to the burgers while they grilled giving them a distinctive flavor As demand increased customers often bought his hamburgers by the dozen giving rise to the company s subsequently popular slogan buy em by the sack Despite some growth Anderson had opened only four stands in the busiest areas of the city In  Edgar Waldo Billy Ingram collaborated with Anderson to open the first White Castle restaurant in Wichita The restaurant was founded on the idea of cooking a hamburger quickly giving it the honor of being the first fast food restaurant Ingram soon realized that the word burger evoked connotations of circus performances at livestock markets and greasy pieces of meat eaten in the poorest districts of the city in the collective mind of the American public He tried to change those connotations from White Castle s earliest days At the same time he became known to some as the Henry Ford of the hamburger while inventing a restaurant concept he called the White Castle System which helped the hamburger achieve fame Between  and  the White Castle System established almost a hundred restaurants in cities throughout the Midwestern United States In order to raise awareness among White Castle employees a newsletter entitled The hot hamburger was circulated throughout the company which challenged the employees to improve the sale of the burgers with a simple idea to be able to prepare burgers rapidly so anyone could purchase and eat them anytime and anywhere Instead of waiting for half an hour to be served at a traditional restaurant the White Castle System provided rapid service and a menu centered around the hamburger At the time the hamburger was typically served with coffee Upton Sinclair s The Jungle had already caused public outrage over the safety of processed meat so by the s the general public had come to expect a clean and hygienic hamburger In addition to offering clean and safe food White Castle offered regularity and standardization ensuring that each patty was served in the same manner in each restaurant At the time this was an entirely novel idea that would revolutionize the sale of food itself with a style that would come to be known as fast food During its early years White Castle emphasized providing quality coffee and collaborated with universities to publish studies on the nutritional quality of their hamburgers The success of the White Castle chain was rooted largely in the power of propaganda something that was both an original innovation and necessary to change the public s negative perception of the hamburger In  it became the first restaurant to advertise in newspapers using its old buy em by the sack slogan White Castle also pioneered the concept of take out service and the restaurant is further known for being the first to market square burgers called sliders which were sold for five cents into the s White Castle was founded in March  in Wichita Kansas by Billy Ingram and his business partner the cook Walter Anderson and they opened a second restaurant in Kansas City in  In  White Castle created its first subsidiary Paperlynen Company which provided the cartons and wrapping paper that the food was served in as well as the hats worn by the kitchen staff It acquired porcelain companies in a similar fashion placing them in charge of building small White Castle restaurants using white porcelain facades Walter Anderson contributed a number of novel ideas to White Castle during its early years including the creation of a special spatula and a special bread for the burgers In  an employee named Earl Howell calculated the amount of time that it took to break hamburgers apart in a presentable fashion eventually leading him to create the perforated burger By  White Castle had incorporated five perforations into its burgers Before Anderson hamburgers were cooked on a grill for an indefinite period of time and minced meat balls were crushed into conventional slices of bread like a sandwich The meat was frozen and hamburgers came to be cooked from frozen instead of using fresh meat White Castle revolutionized the burger making process by regularizing the finished products and using hygienic preparation techniques that were in clear view of the customers White Castle had a very large progression of sales and its success was such that by  it had already generated competitors and imitators in the emerging hamburger business One of these imitators also had a highly similar name White Tower Hamburgers of Milwaukee Wisconsin founded by the father and son tandem of John E and Thomas E Saxe The creation of White Tower led to numerous legal battles between it and White Castle during the s By  White Castle already had  restaurants spread over a distance of   kilometres   mi all of which were located within the United States The company eventually became a large restaurant chain however there has never been a restaurant outside of the United States The American shortage of beef during World War II had little effect on sales across White Castle due to the effect of vertical integration along with the appearance of fast food chains that operated on a franchise model that emphasized horizontal integration McDonald s era In the s McDonald s advertised the ability of a customer to eat the same burger anywhere in the United States and a few decades later it made the same feat possible in much of the world Main article McDonald s In  Patrick McDonald and his two sons Richard and Maurice inaugurated the simple restaurant Airdrome on Huntington Drive Route  near the airport in the American city of Monrovia California The success of its sales eventually led to the May   opening of a restaurant named McDonald s along U S Route  in San Bernardino California After analyzing their sales the brothers discovered that to their surprise  of their revenue was coming from selling hamburgers The menu initially featured  different dishes the majority of which were barbecued Through their new restaurant the McDonald brothers introduced the notion of fast food to parts of the Western United States by  From the beginning McDonald s focused on making hot dogs and hamburgers as efficiently and quickly as possible During the s simple and formative concepts took root at McDonald s including the preparation and service of burgers in just one minute and the ability for customers to eat in their own cars in a drive in style All the while the restaurant was trying to further develop a hamburger that was inexpensive enough to be within the economic reach of most Americans By the s the concept of drive in style service had become firmly established and hamburgers and cars had become closely connected in the minds of many Americans It was now not only possible for a customer to purchase a hamburger without getting out of a car and a customer also no longer needed to wait to be served The McDonald brothers built upon the achievements of their original San Bernardino restaurant when in  they began franchising their now famous chain restaurants starting in Phoenix Arizona and Downey California the latter of which is still in operation Later Ray Kroc opened one in the northwest Chicago suburb of Des Plaines Illinois on April   which has now been converted into the McDonald s Museum It is noteworthy that the original McDonald s mascot was a hamburger faced cook called Speedee that would serve as the iconographic identity of the company until being replaced by the clown Ronald McDonald in  The McDonald brothers intensively studied the existing kitchen protocol of their restaurants in an effort to improve them They looked at different options that could increase the speed of cooking hamburgers designing and patenting special grills that had a higher output made their cutlery and other kitchen utensils disposable and introduced dishwashers that reduced the costs of water soap and labor The brothers also created a detailed system for operating each kitchen throughout the franchise in a similar and largely standardized manner as well as recruiting adolescents as employees in the kitchens The company began to expand at a much faster rate when  year old ice cream machinery salesman Ray Kroc took over as its chief executive Kroc was the initiator of both McDonald s expansion across the United States and the definitive standardization of its burgers He was not alone however as some of his co workers were also very productive and innovative McDonald s executive and food scientist Herb Peterson invented the McMuffin in  and also the now famous greeting May I have your order please In another key development Jim Delligatti of the Pittsburgh franchise invented the Big Mac in  The McDonald s successful expansion was mainly due to its use of the franchise system an innovation borrowed from a sewing machine manufacturer the Singer Corporation Singer had developed it during the late th century and it was so successful that it was soon adopted by its competitors Nowadays McDonald s even has its own university for training its staff Hamburger University located in Oak Brook Illinois Graduates receive a degree entitled bachelor of hamburgerology with a minor in French fries As McDonald s expanded into other countries it encountered more opposition and general difficulties as was the case in  when it opened a restaurant in New Delhi amid outcry from Indian leaders In  the country with the most McDonald s restaurants aside from the United States was Japan followed by Canada and Germany while the company itself had restaurants in more than  countries Throughout its history the company has become a symbol of globalization and Western culture sometimes resulting in it being the subject of anger and protests in various parts of the world Variants The Rite Spot in Pasadena California Many different variants of the hamburger have been created over the years some of which have become very popular Much of this diversity has been the product of other restaurant chains that have tried to reproduce the success of McDonald s and White Castle while others served to influence McDonald s An example of a restaurant that influenced McDonald s and its imitators is Big Boy which was first opened in  by Bob Wian in Glendale California and became known in that locale as Bob s Big Boy It was at this restaurant that a major hamburger variant the double deck cheeseburger with two beef patties was first made Wian s creation was distinctively served by Big Boy restaurants with the bun sliced twice the center slice known as the club section separating the two patties The chain also popularized the drive in restaurant format taken and simplified by McDonald s type fast food operators By the s Big Boy had expanded throughout the United States and Canada Despite the benefits it provided to Wian the chain was sold along with the rights to their signature Big Boy hamburger to the Marriott Corporation in  This same year McDonald s franchisee Jim Delligatti created an imitation of the Big Boy the Big Mac An example of the many McDonald s and White Castle imitators is Kewpee Hamburgers a fast food chain founded in  in Flint Michigan by Samuel V Blair as Kewpee Hotel Hamburgs As with the invention of the hamburger the exact origins of the cheeseburger are unknown Several chefs claim to have been the first to add a slice of cheese to a hamburger Lionel Sternberger of Rite Spot in Pasadena California takes credit for the cheeseburger claiming that he invented it between  and  A description from a  menu from the O Dell Restaurant in Los Angeles reveals that it was serving burgers with slices of cheese at the time Luis Ballast owner of the Humpty Dumpty drive in restaurant in Denver Colorado made an attempt to create a cheeseburger with a registered trademark known as a yellowburger in  J C Reynolds the operator of a bar in Southern California from  to  popularized a pimento burger Processed cheese the type of cheese most used in cheeseburgers was invented in  by Walter Gerber of Thun Switzerland although the first U S patent awarded for it was given to James L Kraft in  Kraft Foods went on to create the first commercial version of sliced processed cheese which was first introduced to the market in  A vegan version of the hamburgerAfter World War II a number of hamburger restaurants known as InstaBurger King later Burger King began emerging the first of which was opened on December   in a suburb of Miami Florida It was established by James McLamore and David Edgerton both of whom were students at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration McLamore had visited the original McDonald s in San Bernardino California when it was still owned by the McDonald brothers and saw the potential that existed for the mass production of hamburgers He was so inspired by this visit that he decided to create a similar burger chain himself By  Burger King already had five restaurants in metropolitan Miami and its early success prompted McLamore and Edgerton to expand throughout the United States by using a franchise system that allowed them to grow the business at a relatively low cost They formed Burger King Corporation as a parent company to the franchises they were selling throughout the United States The Burger King Corporation was acquired by the Pillsbury Company in  and during the s it began to expand outside the United States principally in South America and Europe Burger King s core product has long been the Whopper which was created in  by founder James McLamore and initially sold for  cents Wendy s was founded by Dave Thomas and John T Schuessler on November   in Columbus Ohio By the late s it had become the third largest hamburger company in the United States Wendy s has consistently tried to differentiate itself from other hamburger restaurants by its claim that it makes its burgers using fresh not frozen beef Wendy s sparked a controversy and entered into American pop culture in the s with its Where s the beef advertising slogan and an accompanying campaign stressing the primacy of the beef patty over the hamburger s other ingredients Culinary history J Wellington Wimpy Wimpy on the left one of Popeye s friends from a  cartoon had a tremendous craving for hamburgers The hamburger was very popular among Americans during the postwar period following World War I even in popular culture An example of this was the prominent appearance of hamburgers in E C Segar s Thimble Theatre comic strip which prominently featured a cartoon character named Popeye the Sailor who ate spinach to sustain his superhuman strength Popeye s first appearance was as a supporting character on January   alongside many other characters One of these characters was J Wellington Wimpy often shortened to just Wimpy a lover of hamburgers who was both polite and gluttonous His signature phrase I d gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger today became popular and widely known  During the height of his popularity in the s Wimpy introduced the hamburger to the youth of the time as a healthy food It also resulted in the creation of a chain of fast food restaurants called Wimpy s in his honor which sold hamburgers for ten cents  In a similar fashion the fictional character Jughead Jones who first appeared in Archie Comics in  was passionate about food generally and hamburgers specifically Fictional characters related to the hamburger such as the Ronald McDonald clown character designed by Willard Scott who first appeared on television in  soon became a recognizable part of American culture The burger also made appearances in underground comix such as Zap Comix  during the late s in which cartoonist Robert Crumb designed a character called Hamburger Hi Jinx By the end of the decade pop art was including the hamburger as an artistic element appearing in the works of Andy Warhol Dual Hamburger Claes Oldenburg Floor Burger Mel Ramos Vinaburger  and more recently David LaChapelle Death by Hamburger  An example of the popularity and identification that the burger enjoyed among the American public was the name of the Battle of Hamburger Hill which occurred in May  during the Vietnam War Its name was inspired by the number of American and Vietnamese casualties which made the scene resembles a butcher The hamburger was also the inspiration of Star Wars creator George Lucas s design for the Millennium Falcon ship Hamburgers also appear in computer games as in the case of BurgerTime an arcade style game created in  by Data East Corporation The hamburger also appears prominently on American television shows such as American Eats and Man v Food By the s American society had become highly motorized largely due to the  Federal Highway Act passed by President Dwight Eisenhower and inspired by the German Autobahn as well as the impressive growth rates of American automobile manufacturers at the time Due to the extensive use of cars at the time hamburgers were often served at drive ins often by waiters known as carhops Drive in restaurants first appeared in the United States in the early s and gradually become a common sight across the country The ability to serve hamburgers to customers in their cars was seen as a business opportunity by countless fast food chains especially McDonald s The popularity of the hamburger grew rapidly among the American population during this period and statistics indicate that the average American was eating three burgers per week During the Cold War the hamburger became a national symbol of the United States As private outdoor social events often held in backyards and featuring a barbecue became more widespread during the mid s the hamburger gained a new culinary and social relevance in the country By the late s hamburgers began to grow in size as various burger chains competed with each other resulting in Burger King launching the Whopper and McDonald s launching the Quarter Pounder As the race between the major chains grew more intense the prices of their burgers increased and the days when a hamburger could be bought for just a few cents were numbered In the s major hamburger chains began to use considerable resources in marketing their products They began to compete directly with each other through their advertising much of which was comparative and often featured direct allusions and comparisons The event came to be jokingly referred to as the burger wars by many Americans By the end of the s the era of slogans in large chain restaurants had begun Global phenomenon The Vietnamese riceburger is a product of the globalization of the hamburger The modern hamburger was developed in the United States but by the end of World War II around the middle of the th century it began to spread to other countries as fast food became globalized The main cause of this gradual globalization was the successes of the large restaurant chains Their desires to expand their businesses and increase their profits resulted in them creating franchises around the world McDonald s was among the first of the burger chains to take the global establishment of its brand seriously but it was not the only one Wimpy began operating in the United Kingdom in   years before McDonald s began operation in the country and by  it had expanded to over a thousand restaurants in  countries On August   in Zaandam near Amsterdam in the Netherlands Ahold opened its first European franchise In the s McDonald s began to expand into Europe and Australia In Asia Japan saw the establishment of its own fast food chain in  MOS Burger Mosu b g an abbreviation of Mountain Ocean Sun which eventually became a direct competitor to McDonald s All of its products however were variations on the burger adapted to the Asian world including the teriyaki burger takumi burger and riceburger In Hong Kong Aji Ichiban competed with large chains before it spread quickly throughout Asia One of the first hamburger vending machines debuted in Amsterdam in  under the brand FEBO its name derived from its original place of creation the Ferdinand Bolstraat At the same time the hamburger was growing in popularity around the world it took on a variety of local features in different locations Such examples of this include ground meat made from local animals such as kangaroos in Australia or Tex Mex style dishes like chilli con carne The expansion and standardization of the hamburger has led to the creation of a price index that can be used as an economic reference between different countries known as the Big Mac Index It measures the worth in US of a burger in different parts of the world allowing for the comparison of the purchasing power parity of  national economies in which McDonald s does business American sociologist George Ritzer coined the related concept of McDonaldization in his  book McDonaldization of Society Another byproduct of the globalization of fast food was the creation of international competitive eating contests that involve contestants from many different countries One of the best known contests is the Krystal Square Off run by the fast food chain Krystal and sponsored by the International Federation of Competitive Eating IFOC which has been held annually since  Present day Astronauts eating hamburgers in space thanks to the design of the space food provided at the International Space Station ISS In the th century the hamburger has appeared as the central topic in some books on the literature of culinary topics An example of this is Fast Food Nation The Dark Side of the All American Meal published by investigative journalist Eric Schlosser in  that examines the local and global influence of the American fast food industry An example of a modern variation of the hamburger is the so called gourmet burger which is made by haute cuisine chefs with patties that include luxury ingredients One of the first such burgers was cooked in New York City by chef Daniel Boulud in June  and subsequently sold for US  with loin ribs Bres canned black truffles and a mirepoix of vegetables The Manhattan restaurant Old Homestead one of the oldest steakhouses in the country offers a  hamburger with beef bred Japanese wagy An haute cuisine burger created by Richard Blais a student of Ferran Adri was introduced in  at a restaurant in Atlanta where it is served with a crystal chain and a silk ribbon In response to the haute cuisine take on the hamburger others have created more humble versions Alberto Chicote of Madrid makes homemade hamburgers in his kitchen using Iberian pork along with homemade ketchup and mustard In  Max Schondor created a hamburger made of soy In a  episode of SpongeBob SquarePants the adventurous title character visits Mr Krabs s popular Krabby Patty burgers where hamburgers figure prominently in the story In the United States during the th century there have been numerous celebrations marking the centenary of the burger Two locations in particular organized high profile events to celebrate  years of the hamburger One was held in Athens Texas in November  in honor of Fletcher Davis In a resolution made by the state of Texas it was established that Athens is the Original Home of Hamburger However in August  the state of Wisconsin made the same claim on behalf of the town of Seymour the home of Charlie Nagreen who also claimed to be the creator of the hamburger These two decisions have split the honor of creating the hamburger between these two American cities The town of Seymour continues to annually celebrate a Burger Fest on the first Saturday of each August Nutritional controversies Since the latter part of the th century the burger has undergone several controversies regarding its nutritional values In an era in which a growing amount of the world s population has become either overweight or more conscious of weight and the need for a healthy diet in general the appearance of exceptionally larger burgers popularly known as XXL hamburgers has generated considerable controversy One example of this is the Triple Whopper which surpasses the   calorie threshold established by the Health Strategy Against Obesity which is promoted by the health institutes of the Spanish Association of Food and Nutrition Safety AESAN AESAN works to prevent the growth of the incidence of obesity in all people particularly children More generally dietitians are beginning to see that the consumption of foods high in calories can cause excessive appetite In response to this message many restaurant chains have reduced the calories in their burgers since the beginning of the th century The late th century witnessed a lawsuit brought by McDonald s against two environmental activists Helen Steel and David Morris that was colloquially known as the McLibel case McDonald s took action following the publication of a pamphlet by Steel and Morris that was entitled What s wrong with McDonald s Everything they don t want you to know which was subsequently developed into a documentary called McLibel Media In  Morgan Spurlock addressed the obsessive consumption of hamburgers by some Americans by directing and starring in the documentary film Super Size Me In the film he himself eats only McDonald s food for an entire month and documents how his health changes That same year saw the premiere of Harold Kumar Go to White Castle a film in which White Castle restaurants played a vital part Two years later in  the film Fast Food Nation presented a fictional representation of the intrigues and machinations of the meat industry on the border between Mexico and the United States It is largely based on the  book Fast Food Nation The Dark Side of

Swiss cheeseVariationsSourdough bread Texas toast Thousand Island dressing American cheese Media Patty melt A patty melt is an American grilled sandwich consisting of a ground beef patty topped with melted cheese and caramelized onions between two slices of griddled seeded rye bread Description and ingredients The patty melt is variously described as a variant of the traditional American cheeseburger topped with fried onions and served on sliced bread instead of a traditional bun or as a variant of a grilled cheese that includes a hamburger patty and fried onions The sandwich consists of a ground beef patty topped with melted cheese traditionally Swiss cheese and usually with caramelized onions between two slices of griddled bread typically caraway seeded rye or marbled rye though sourdough or Texas toast are sometimes substituted in some regions including the Southern U S It is typically made without condiments or garnishes Like a grilled cheese the patty melt maintains its structural integrity when eaten as all ingredients are grilled at the same time and assembled while still hot which melds the grilled bread hamburger patty cheese and onions into a single unit that doesn t fall apart while being eaten History and origins Sandwiches calling for hamburger patties to be placed into two slices of bread rather that into a bun date to the mid s and were referred to as hamburger sandwiches It is unclear when the patty melt was invented but it was most likely the mid th century either during the Great Depression or the postwar economic boom Several culinary writers have suggested that Los Angeles restaurateur Tiny Naylor may have invented the patty melt sometime between  and  depending on the source it was on the menu at Tiny Naylor s in the early s Even if Naylor did not invent the sandwich it is agreed that he and his family helped popularize the sandwich in their restaurants and in restaurants where they worked which included Tiny Naylor s Du par s and Wolfgang Puck s Granita Popularity According to New York Times food writer Pete Wells in  the sandwich is virtually unknown outside of the United States Wells theorizes that the amount of space on a flattop grill required to grill onions patty and bread at the same time has restricted its appeal outside of typical short order restaurants It is typically on the menu of diners coffee shops and lunch counters but in the early s it started to appear on some upscale menus Home cooking Home cooks typically make patty melts in a cast iron skillet in steps by separately grilling the patties caramelizing the onions assembling the sandwich and then grilling it as for a grilled cheese sandwich Gentleman s Quarterly called it the great indoor burger See also List of American sandwiches List

originUnited StatesRegion or stateMidwestServing temperatureHot with various cheeses vegetables and condimentsMain ingredientsBun slider roll filling e g hamburger patty Media Slider A slider is an American term for a small sandwich typically around  inches  cm across made with a bun or dinner roll Sliders can be served as hors d oeuvres snacks or entr es They have become a popular game day appetizer in the United States History The name slider is believed to have been first used to describe the onion steamed small burgers at White Castle restaurants The term has since been picked up by other restaurants usually to describe a small hamburger but sometimes used to describe any small sandwich made with a slider bun White Castle later trademarked the spelling variant Slyder and used it between  and  Cheeseburger sliders Chicken sliders Etymology The etymology of the term slider is uncertain Food historian George Motz has cited two competing origin stories for the term There are two stories about the history of the word slider both from White Castle One is that they re so small they slide down your throat that s the obvious choice The other choice which I like better is that in the old days White Castle was sort of like a show You d walk in and there would be two or three men behind the counter in white paper caps and clean white aprons on They d greet you when you came in it was sort of a fun happy environment And if you were sitting at the counter they would make your burger everything was served on porcelain and they would slide the burger down the counter to you That s how they became known as sliders White Castle likes both stories they haven t picked a favorite See also Food portal Burger King sliders Krystal List of hamburgers References Campanaro Joey

ingredientsVegetables textured vegetable protein legumes nuts mushrooms or grains or seeds Media Veggie burger A veggie burger is a hamburger made with a patty that does not contain meat or the patty of such a hamburger The patty may be made from ingredients like beans especially soybeans and tofu nuts grains seeds or fungi such as mushrooms or mycoprotein The essence of the veggie burger patty has existed in various Eurasian cuisines for millennia including in the form of grilled or fried meatless discs or as koftas a commonplace item in Indian cuisine These may be made of entirely vegetarian ingredients such as legumes or other plant derived proteins Some popular brands of veggie burger include the Boca Burger the Gardenburger Morningstar Farms and Quorn In the s realistic imitations were developed led by the companies Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods Origin There have been numerous claims of invention of the veggie burger The dish by name may have been created in London in  by Gregory Sams who called it the VegeBurger Sams and his brother Craig had run a natural food restaurant in Paddington since the s a Carrefour hypermarket in Southampton sold  packets in three weeks after its launch An earlier reference can be heard in the  June  episode of the American radio drama series Let George Do It called The Mister Mirch Case where a character refers to vegeburgers as a burger made of nuts and legumes Using the name Gardenburger an early veggie burger was developed by Paul Wenner around  or  in Wenner s vegetarian restaurant The Gardenhouse in Gresham Oregon Restaurants Some fast food companies have been offering vegetarian foods increasingly since the beginning of the st century India In India where vegetarianism is widespread McDonald s Burger King Wendy s and KFC serve veggie burgers In  McDonald s opened its first vegetarian only restaurant in India A popular type of burger is the Vada pav also known as the Bombay burger It originated in or near the city of Mumbai and consists of a fritter vada cooked with potatoes mixed with green chilis and various spices enclosed in a bread roll pav United States Burger King BK introduced a veggie burger in  the first to be made available nationally in the U S They have also sold veggie burgers in their Australian franchise Hungry Jack s In  BK rolled out the Impossible Whopper as a veggie burger that realistically imitates their signature beef based Whopper hamburger Veggie burgers have been sold in certain Subways and Harvey s as well as many chain restaurants such as Red Robin Chili s Denny s Friendly s Culvers Johnny Rockets and Hard Rock Cafe Occasionally the veggie burger option will appear at the bottom of a menu as a possible substitution for beef or turkey burgers rather than as an individual menu item McDonald s A McVeggie sandwich from a McDonald s in India Different kinds of veggie burgers including the vegetarian McVeggie the vegan McVegan and the McPlant are also served permanently in McDonald s restaurants in India McVeggie consisting of a fried breaded patty of ground vegetables with lettuce and ketchup in a wholewheat sesame or

lettuce and ketchup in a sesame bun Malaysia The Netherlands Groentenburger Vegetable Burger Portugal McVeggie since November  New Zealand McVeggie since December  Sweden McVegan Switzerland Vegi Mac United Arab Emirates United Kingdom McPlant Manufacturing process Manufacturing often follows certain steps One commercial recipe runs as follows The grains and vegetables used in the patties are first washed and thoroughly cleaned to help ensure the removal of dirt bacteria chemical residues and other materials that may be on the raw products This process can either be done by hand or through the use of machinery such as high pressure sprayers With the use of a conveyor belt the food is moved along under a high pressure sprayer to remove the debris listed above Another method that may be used by companies is the use of a hollow drum which circulates the food while water is sprayed onto it to remove the debris Grains of rice before cooking Next a steam heated mixer is used to cook the grain and remove any extra debris and excess water The mixer typically has oils within it such as safflower oil As the oil simmers the grains are gradually added in and the blades are used to mix the grains around The steam created in the mixer allows the grains to cook resulting in a puree Next the vegetables are cut up into smaller pieces to allow more surface area for cooking purposes This can be done by hand or through the use of machines in factories The vegetables are then added to the grain mixture in the steam heated mixture The exact ratio of grains to vegetables is unique to each company resulting in different textures and tastes that are produced As the vegetables are being cooked in the mixer their natural sugars release resulting in caramelization The sweet flavors thus created from this caramelization are mixed uniformly in the mixer The technique used for the creation of this caramelization mixture is called mirepoix This technique is very important to the production of veggie burgers as it adds both texture and flavor to the patty Dry ingredients such as oats can be added to the manufacturing process The mirepoix mixture is then placed into another mixing tub where dry ingredients such as oats walnuts potato flakes and more are added The mixture is then folded together to make a uniform mix The moisture from the vegetables causes the mixture to become sticky thus clumping together like cookie dough This is important as it allows the veggie burger to stick together to form the patty The mixture is now put into an automatic patty making machine or press The press then punches out the patties into a disc shape onto a conveyor belt underneath A constant spray of water may also be used to prevent any of the mixture from sticking to machinery parts Once on the conveyor tray the patties move along to be put onto baking trays Patties are first inspected to make sure they are the correct shape size and texture to ensure a high quality product The trays are then put into a heated convection oven at a designated temperature and time Once out of the oven the patties are quickly frozen with techniques such as individual quick freezing and cryogenic freezing These quick freezing methods freeze the patties within  minutes to lock in nutrients and preserve texture by the formation of a number of small ice crystals The frozen patties are again placed on a conveyor belt that takes them to a vacuum packaging machine The machine seals the patties into measured plastic sleeves and draws out any excess air The packages are then loaded into printed cardboard boxes with the aid of another machine or done manually The flaps on the box are then sealed closed and the product is kept in temperature controlled storage before during and after delivery to grocery stores Ingredients purpose Grains Fresh corn ready for production Grains are primarily used in the manufacturing of veggie burgers to act as a meat substitute The grains such as rice and wheat provide carbohydrates and protein components and to provide bulk to the patty They also provide texture to the burger which can change depending on the type of grain used This texture and look is important as they wish to make the patty look like a beef patty Vegetables Vegetables such as corn carrots and mushrooms provide the patty with texture and taste Additionally they provide moisture when heated This allows the disc shape without breaking apart easily The vegetables also provide nutrients with the addition of some vitamins and minerals Mushrooms prior to cooking Dry ingredients Adding dry ingredients such as oats flours nuts or breadcrumbs can absorb excess moisture and liquid which results in the patty sticking together tightly This could turn the moist veggie patties into a sticky consistency which also helps the patties shape easily Dry ingredients provide proteins and fiber which add nutritional value to the veggie patty Dry ingredients such as walnuts and almonds are also rich in energy vitamins and minerals Stabilizers Tapioca starch and vegetable gum are two common ingredients used as stabilizers in veggie burger Tapioca starch is often used as a thickening agent for manufactured foods due to its cheaper price It gets sticky once it is wet which helps to hold the burger patty tightly together This prevents the patty from breaking apart Vegetable gum provides negligible nutrients but it also helps to hold everything together in the patty Oils Oils such as safflower coconut and olive oil can lubricate the grain mix and allow further cooking processing when the wheat is added This facilitates the Maillard reaction and makes the veggie patty taste better by bringing out its flavors Oils can also prevent the ingredients from sticking to the mixing machine thus allowing them to be mixed well and heated together Preservatives Salt is typically used for flavor but may be used as a preservative in veggie burgers With the use of salt the water activity of the food is reduced This helps prevent the growth of micro organisms and prolongs the shelf life of the food Naming In October  the EU rejected an amendment proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which if passed would have resulted in companies being forced to call veggie burgers by the term veggie discs Gallery A Burger King Veggie combo meal
